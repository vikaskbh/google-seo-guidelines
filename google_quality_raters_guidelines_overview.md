# Search Quality Rater Guidelines: Overview

## Introduction
- Google Search exists to help people find **helpful, relevant, and reliable information**.
- Search is not a solved problem — continuous improvements are made.
- Feedback from **Search Quality Raters** helps evaluate changes.

## How Search Works
Google relies on three pillars for information quality:

1. **High-quality automated ranking**  
   - Systems match queries with useful, reliable content.
   - Handles misspellings, synonyms, natural language, etc.

2. **Helpful Search features**  
   - Provides access to authoritative sources (e.g., government, NGOs).
   - Adds features that help users interpret results.

3. **Content policies**  
   - Rules to ensure only high-quality, safe, and helpful content appears.

Ranking systems:
- Return relevant + reliable results.
- Use **signals** (links from trusted sites, reputation, freshness) to estimate quality.
- Automated systems can’t fully judge exaggeration, misinformation, or harm — need human input.

## Improving Search
- All proposed changes go through a **rigorous evaluation process**:
  - User research
  - Search Quality Tests (raters)
  - Live experiments on small % of users
- In 2022, more than **4,700 improvements** launched.
- Review process includes data science, product, privacy, and legal checks.

## The Search Quality Rating Process
- ~16,000 external raters worldwide.
- Provide feedback using common guidelines.
- Two main rating dimensions:

### 1. **Page Quality (PQ)**
- Goal: judge how well a page achieves its purpose.  
- Steps:
  1. **Determine purpose** (e.g., inform, sell, entertain).  
  2. **Assess harm** (malicious, deceptive → Lowest rating).  
  3. **Assign quality rating**: Lowest, Low, Medium, High, Highest.
- Factors considered:
  - **Main Content (MC) quality**: effort, originality, skill.  
  - **Transparency**: clear info about site + content creators.  
  - **Reputation**: evidence from users and experts.  
  - **E-E-A-T**: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust.  
- **YMYL pages** (finance, health, safety, civic info) require very high standards.

### 2. **Needs Met (NM)**
- Goal: judge how well a result satisfies user intent.  
- Steps:
  1. **Understand user intent** from query + location.  
  2. **Rate usefulness** of result:  
     - Fully Meets (FM)  
     - Highly Meets (HM)  
     - Moderately Meets (MM)  
     - Slightly Meets (SM)  
     - Fails to Meet (FailsM)

## The Raters
- Represent real search users in their locale.  
- Must know the local language, culture, and context.  
- Diversity across regions (NA, LATAM, EMEA, APAC).  
- Must pass tests on guidelines to qualify.  
- Instructed to avoid personal opinions/bias.

---

## Key Principles
- Pages should be created to **help people**.  
- Harmful, deceptive, spammy pages = **Lowest quality**.  
- **YMYL topics** must meet the **highest E-E-A-T standards**.  
- Search Quality Ratings **do not directly change rankings** of specific sites.  
  - Instead, they train and validate Google’s algorithms in aggregate.

---

## Summary
- Google’s mission: make useful, reliable information accessible globally.  
- Continuous improvements rely on rigorous testing + real user feedback.  
- Raters evaluate results with **Page Quality (PQ)** and **Needs Met (NM)** frameworks.  
- **E-E-A-T** and **YMYL** principles are critical for judging trustworthiness.  
- Ratings are aggregated to measure and improve systems — not to rank individual sites directly.
