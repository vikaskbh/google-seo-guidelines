# Search Quality Rater Guidelines (Full Summary)


## General Guidelines 

### Overview 


Welcome to the Search Quality Rating Program! As a Search Quality Rater, you will work on many different types of rating projects. The General Guidelines primarily cover Page Quality (PQ) rating and Needs Met (NM) rating; however, the concepts are also important for many other types of rating tasks. For brevity, we refer to “Search Quality Raters” as “raters” in these guidelines.

- Raters Must Represent People in their Rating Locale It is very important for you to represent people in the locale you evaluate. You must be very familiar with the task language and location in order to represent the experience of people in your locale. If you do not have the knowledge to do this, please inform your employer/company. Unless your rating task indicates otherwise, your ratings should be based on the instructions and examples given in these guidelines. Ratings should not be based on your personal opinions, preferences, religious beliefs, or political views. Always use your best judgment and represent the cultural standards of your rating locale. 

-  Browser Requirements 
  Check with your employer/company for browser requirements. You may use helpful browser add-ons or extensions, but please do not use add-ons or extensions that interfere with or alter the user experience of the page. 

-  Ad Blocking Extensions 
  Do not use add-ons or extensions that block ads for Needs Met rating or Page Quality rating. These add-ons or extensions may cause you to give incorrect ratings. As a rater, only use an ad blocking extension or add-on if specifically instructed to do so in the project-specific instructions. Important : Some browsers such as Chrome automatically block some ads. As a rater, you are required to turn off any ad blocker capabilities of the browser you use to view webpages for rating tasks. Check your browser settings before rating tasks to ensure your ratings accurately reflect how people experience the page without ad blocking settings and extensions. For more information about Chrome Ad Blocking, see Chrome Support Page for Ad Blocking Settings . 

-  Internet Safety Information 
  In the course of your work, you will visit many different webpages. Some of them may harm your computer unless you are careful. Please do not download any executables, applications, or other potentially dangerous files, or click on any links that you are uncomfortable with. It is strongly recommended that you have antivirus and antispyware protection on your computer. This software must be updated frequently or your computer will not be protected. There are many free and for-purchase antivirus and antispyware products available on the web . See here for a Wikipedia page on antivirus software and here for a Wikipedia page on spyware. We suggest that you only open files with which you are comfortable. The file formats listed below are generally considered safe if antivirus software is in place.

  -- .txt (text files) 
  -- .ppt or .pptx (Microsoft PowerPoint) 
  -- .doc or .docx (Microsoft Word) 
  -- .xls or .xlsx (Microsoft Excel) 
  -- .pdf (PDF files) (Adobe Acrobat) If you encounter a page with a warning message, such as “Warning-visiting this web site may harm your computer,” or if your antivirus software warns you about a page, you should not try to visit the page to assign a rating.

## Page Quality Rating Guideline 

### Introduction to Page Quality Rating 

  A Page Quality (PQ) rating task consists of a URL and a grid to record your observations as you explore the landing page and the website associated with the URL. The goal of PQ rating is to evaluate how well the page achieves its purpose. Here's what you'll need to be a successful Page Quality rater: 

  -- Your experience using the web as an ordinary user in your rating locale. 
  -- In-depth knowledge of these guidelines. 
  -- And most importantly—practice doing PQ rating tasks! 

### Understanding Webpages and Websites 

Page Quality rating requires an in-depth understanding of websites. We'll start with the basics. Along the way, we'll share important information about Page Quality rating, so please read through this section even if you are a website expert! 

  #### Important Definitions 

  Here are some important definitions: A search engine is a tool to help people find or interact with content available on the Internet. In these guidelines, the word " user " refers to a person trying to find information or accomplish a task on the Internet. Users are people from many different backgrounds, whose experiences and needs may differ from your own: people of all ages, genders, races, religions, political affiliations, etc. A webpage is connected to the World Wide Web and can be viewed or "visited" using a web browser (e.g., Chrome), a browser on your phone, or a search app. In the 1990s, webpage content was mostly text and links. Today, webpage content includes many forms of media (such as images, videos, etc.) and functionality (such as online shopping features, email, calculator functionality, online games, etc.). A URL is a string of letters, numbers, and punctuation that your web browser uses to “find” and display a webpage. Page Quality rating doesn't require you to have in-depth understanding of the structure of URLs, i.e., you don’t need to know the difference between host, domain, etc. But if you are interested, see here to read more. A website or site is a group of World Wide Web pages usually containing hyperlinks to each other and made available online by an individual, company, educational institution, government, or organization. Popular websites include Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo, YouTube, etc. Note : In these guidelines, we will use the word “website” to refer to a collection of pages owned and controlled by a single entity (individual, business, etc.). But we will also use “website” to refer to major “independent” sections (or hosts) of some websites that were created to achieve separate purposes. For example, the Yahoo website is organized into different sections (or hosts), such as Yahoo Finance ( finance.yahoo.com ), Yahoo Mail ( mail.yahoo.com ), Yahoo Sports ( sports.yahoo.com ), etc. Each of these has its own purpose. It’s OK to refer to each of these sections as a website; for example, the Yahoo Finance website and the Yahoo Sports website. You may also refer to pages on Yahoo Finance or Yahoo Sports as belonging to the Yahoo website. A homepage of a website is the main page of the site. It is usually the first page that users see when the site loads. For example, http://www.apple.com is the homepage of the Apple site, http://www.yahoo.com is the homepage of the Yahoo company site, and http://finance.yahoo.com is the homepage of Yahoo Finance. You can usually find the homepage of a website by clicking on a “home” link or logo link on subpages of a website. A website owner is the person, company, or organization who is responsible for a website.

  ### Understanding the Purpose of a Webpage

  Here is an example (OmNomNomNom Page) of a helpful page where the purpose of the page is not as obvious. At first glance, this page may seem pointless or strange. However, it is a page from a humorous site that encourages users to post photos with mouths drawn on them. The purpose of the page is humor or artistic expression. This page has a helpful or beneficial purpose. Even though the About page on this website is not very helpful, the website explains itself on its FAQ page. Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) Topics Pages on the World Wide Web are about a vast variety of topics. Some topics have a high risk of harm because content about these topics could significantly impact the health, financial stability, or safety of people, or the welfare or well-being of society. We call these topics “Your Money or Your Life” or YMYL. YMYL topics may significantly impact or harm one or more of the following: 

    -- the person who is directly viewing or using the content 
    -- other people who are affected by the person who viewed the content 
    -- groups of people or society affected by the actions of people who viewed the content YMYL topics can directly and significantly impact people’s health, financial stability or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society, because of the following reasons: 
    -- The topic itself is harmful or dangerous . For example, there is clear and present harm directly associated with topics related to self-harm, criminal acts, or violent extremism. 
    -- The topic could cause harm if the content is not accurate and trustworthy . For example, mild inaccuracies or content from less reliable sources could significantly impact someone's health, financial stability, or safety, or impact society, for topics like: symptoms of a heart attack, how to invest money, what to do if there is an earthquake, who can vote, or needed qualifications for obtaining a driver’s license. To determine whether a topic is YMYL, assess the following types of harm that might occur: 
    -- YMYL Health or Safety : Topics that could harm mental, physical, and emotional health, or any form of safety such as physical safety or safety online. 
    -- YMYL Financial Security : Topics that could damage a person's ability to support themselves and their families. 
    -- YMYL Society : Topics that could negatively impact groups of people, issues of public interest, trust in public institutions, etc 
    -- YMYL Othe r: Topics that could hurt people or negatively impact welfare or well-being of society. It's possible to imagine a hypothetical harmful page for any non-harmful topic, such as the science behind rainbows or shopping for pencils: for either of these topics, someone could build a page that has a malicious computer virus download. However, for a specific topic to be YMYL, the topic itself must potentially impact people’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society. Many or most topics are not YMYL and do not require a high level of accuracy or trust to prevent harm . Because YMYL assessment is a spectrum, it may be helpful to think of topics as clear YMYL , definitely not YMYL or something in between. Pages on clear YMYL topics require the most scrutiny for Page Quality rating.

### Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) Topics

If you are having trouble deciding whether a topic is YMYL, consider the following questions: 1. Would a careful person seek out experts or highly trusted sources to prevent harm ? Could even minor inaccuracies cause harm? If yes, then the topic is likely YMYL. 2. Is the specific topic one that most people would be content with only casually consulting their friends about? If yes, the topic is likely not YMYL. Important : For pages about clear YMYL topics, we have very high Page Quality rating standards because low quality pages on such topics could potentially negatively impact a person’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society. Understanding Webpage Content All of the content on a webpage can be classified as one of the following: Main Content (MC), Supplementary Content (SC), or Advertisements/Monetization (Ads). In order to understand the purpose of a webpage and do PQ rating, you will need to be able to distinguish among these different parts of the page. Webpage design can be complicated, so make sure to click around and explore the page. See what kind of content is behind the tabs and test out the interactive page features. Content behind the tabs may be considered part of the MC, SC, or Ads, depending on what the content is. 2.Identifying the Main Content (MC) 

### Understanding Webpage Content

#### Identifying the Main Content (MC)

Main Content is any part of the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose. MC can be text, images, videos, page features (e.g., calculators, games), and it can be content created by website users, such as videos, reviews, articles, comments posted by users, etc. Tabs on some pages lead to even more information (e.g., customer reviews) and can sometimes be considered part of the MC. The MC also includes the title at the top of the page ( example ). Descriptive MC titles allow users to make informed decisions about what pages to visit. Helpful titles summarize the MC on the page. Type of Page and Purpose MC Highlighted in Yellow News website homepage: the purpose is to inform users about recent or important events. MC - News Homepage News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. MC - News Article Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. Content behind the Reviews, Shipping, and Safety Information tabs are considered to be part of the MC. MC - Shopping Page Currency converter page: the purpose is to calculate equivalent amounts in different currencies. MC - Currency Converter Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. MC - Blog Post Page Search engine homepage: the purpose is to allow users to enter a query and search the Internet. MC - Search Engine Homepage Bank login page: the purpose is to allow users to log in to bank online. MC - Bank Login Page  

#### Identifying the Supplementary Content (SC)

Identifying the Supplementary Content (SC) Supplementary Content contributes to a good user experience on the page, but does not directly help the page achieve its purpose. SC is an important part of the user experience. One common type of SC is navigation links that allow users to visit other parts of the website. In some cases, content behind tabs may be considered part of the SC. Sometimes the easiest way to identify SC is to look for the parts of the page that are not MC or Ads. Type of Page and Purpose SC Highlighted in Blue News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. SC - News Article Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. SC - Shopping Page Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. SC - Blog Post Page 2.

#### Identifying Advertisements/Monetization (Ads)

Identifying Advertisements/Monetization (Ads) Ads may contribute to a good user experience. Advertisements/Monetization (Ads) is content and/or links that are displayed for the purpose of monetizing (making money from) the page. The presence or absence of Ads is not by itself a reason for a High or Low quality rating. Without advertising and monetization, some webpages could not exist because it costs money to maintain a website and create high quality content. There are many different ways to monetize a webpage, including advertisements and affiliate programs. See here for more information on website monetization. Note that monetization on mobile pages may be more subtle than monetization on desktop pages. The most common type of monetization is advertisements. Ads may be labeled as "ads," "sponsored links," “sponsored listings,” “sponsored results,” etc. Ads may change when you reload the page, and different users may see different Ads on the same page. Website owners can choose to display Ads on their page (such as by joining an advertising network ), but they may not always directly control the content of the Ads. However, we will consider a website responsible for the overall quality of the Ads displayed. Important: For the purpose of these guidelines, we will consider monetized links of any type to be “Ads.” See here for different types of website monetization. Type of Page and Purpose Ads Highlighted in Red News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. Ads - News Article Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. Ads - Blog Post Page Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. No ads – Shopping 

 #### Summary of the Parts of the Page Let's put it all together. 

  -- Main Content (MC) is any part of the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose. MC is (or should be!) the reason the page exists. The quality of the MC plays a very large role in the Page Quality rating of a webpage. 
  -- Supplementary Content (SC) is also important. SC can help a page better achieve its purpose or it can detract from the overall experience. 
  -- Many pages have advertisements/monetization (Ads) . Without advertising and monetization, some webpages could not exist because it costs money to maintain a website and create high quality content. The presence or absence of Ads is not by itself a reason for a High or Low quality rating. On some pages, user reviews and comments may be considered MC, and on other pages they may be considered SC. Use your best judgment and think about the purpose of the page.  14

- Do not worry too much about identifying every little part of the page. Think about which parts of the page are the MC. Next, look for the Ads. Anything left over can be considered SC. Type of Page and Purpose MC, SC, & Ads Highlighted News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. Summary - News Article Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. Summary - Shopping Page Currency converter page: the purpose is to calculate equivalent amounts in different currencies. Summary - Currency Converter Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. Summary - Blog Post Page Bank login page: the purpose is to allow users to log in to the bank online. Summary - Bank Login Page Understanding the Website Pages often make more sense when viewed as part of a website. Some of the criteria in Page Quality rating are based on understanding the website that the page belongs to. To understand a website, start by finding out who is responsible for the website and who created the content on the page (more information provided in Section 2.). Then, look for information about the website and/or content creators on the website itself. Websites and content creators are usually very eager to tell you all about themselves! You must also look for reputation information about the website and/or content creators. What do outside, independent sources say about them? When there is disagreement between what the website or content creators say about themselves and what reputable independent sources say, trust the independent sources. 

#### Finding the Homepage

Finding the Homepage The homepage of a website usually contains or has links to important information about the website. Website owners usually make it easy to get to the homepage from any page on the site. Here's how to find the homepage of a website: 1. Examine the landing page of the URL in your PQ rating task. 2. Find and click on the link labeled with the name or logo of the website (occasionally labeled as “home" or “main"), which usually appears at the top of the page. Sometimes, you may be given a webpage or website that appears to have no navigation links, no homepage link, and no logo or other means to find the homepage. Even some High or Highest quality pages lack a way to navigate to the homepage. If you can't find a link to the homepage, modify the URL by removing everything to the right of “.com,” “.org,” “.net,” “.fr,” etc. and refresh the page. Occasionally, your rating task will include a URL for which there are two or more justifiable “homepage” candidates. For example, you may not be sure whether the homepage of the URL https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar is http://finance.yahoo.com or http://www.yahoo.com . Important : When you have more than one homepage “candidate,” please use whichever one offers the most information about the specific webpage in the rating task. Use your judgment. The goal is to understand the webpage and the website(s) it is associated with, not find the one unique, correct homepage.  15

### Overall Page Quality Rating

- Overall Page Quality Rating Now that you are an expert in understanding websites and webpages, here are the high-level steps of Page Quality rating: 1. Assess the true purpose of the page. If the website or page has a harmful purpose or is designed to deceive people about its true purpose, it should be rated Lowest . 2. Assess the potential of the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines. Websites or pages that are harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as defined in these guidelines should be rated Lowest . 3. Otherwise, the PQ rating is based on how well the page achieves its purpose as described in these guidelines. Important : There are harmful pages that are seemingly “official”, “expert”, or “authoritative”. Any type of website may have pages with harmful MC, from user-uploaded videos and forum posts to harmful products sold online to pages to pages that mimic the look of scientific papers or encyclopedia entries. All pages should be evaluated for harm—including pages on government websites, academic institutions, reputable online stores, charities, or other types of generally helpful websites. On Page Quality rating tasks, you will use the Page Quality sliding scale (slider) to assign the overall PQ rating. The slider looks like this: You may also use the in-between ratings of Lowest+ , Low+ , Medium+ , and High+ . Please interpret the “+” as “+ ½,” meaning that the Lowest+ rating is halfway between Lowest and Low , Low+ is halfway between Low and Medium , etc. Identifying Lowest and Low quality pages can be the most difficult part of PQ rating. The guidance in the sections on Lowest and Low is more extensive to help you rate accurately. High and Highest quality pages are typically easier to identify, but be sure to apply the standards and examine the examples throughout these guidelines to help calibrate your ratings. As might be expected, Medium quality pages are commonly found online. Page Quality Rating Considerations The following table summarizes the things that you should consider in Page Quality rating. Upcoming sections of these guidelines will elaborate on these considerations and explain how they apply to pages across the PQ rating scale. Consideration Why it's Important for Page Quality Rating The purpose of the page If the page has a harmful purpose, or if it is designed to deceive people about its true purpose or who is responsible for the content, it should be rated Lowest . Otherwise, PQ rating is the process of determining how well a page achieves its purpose. The potential for the page or website to cause harm as described in these guidelines Websites or pages that are harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as described in these guidelines should be rated Lowest . The topic of the page and the extent to which that topic is YMYL The topic of the page helps determine the standards for your overall PQ assessment. Pages on YMYL topics have higher standards than pages on non-YMYL topics.  19

- Consideration Why it's Important for Page Quality Rating The type of website Different types of websites and webpages have different expectations for PQ rating. For example, PQ expectations may differ for: 
  -- Small hobbyist websites vs. large corporate websites 
  -- Websites involving financial transactions vs. websites that do not require payment or collect personal information 
  -- Websites with content created by ordinary people on a volunteer basis vs. websites with content created by professionals Information provided by the website and content creator While the information that websites and content creators provide about themselves isn't always trustworthy, it can provide an important starting point. Quality of the MC Consider the extent to which the MC is satisfying and helps the page achieve its purpose. The title of the page The title of the page is considered part of the MC. Descriptive MC titles that summarize the page allow people to make informed decisions about what pages to visit. The role of Ads and SC on the page Consider the ways in which the Ads and SC contribute to how people experience the page. Remember : Many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration for PQ rating. Reputation of the website and content creator Research the reputation of the website and the content creator to learn about how others view the website and who is behind it. Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T Assess how trustworthy the page is. Experience, Expertise and Authoritativeness can help with your assessment of Trust. Some types of pages require a high level of Trust. Important : These considerations overlap. For example, while examining the quality of the MC, you may notice factual inaccuracies that lower your assessment of Trust. While conducting reputation research, you may find information about the expertise of the content creator which increases your level of Trust. This is how PQ rating is designed to work!  20

- Quality of the Main Content The quality of the Main Content (MC) is one of the most important considerations for PQ rating. The MC plays a major role in determining how well a page achieves its purpose. The unifying theme for evaluating the quality of the MC is the extent to which the MC allows the page to achieve its purpose and offers a satisfying user experience. For most pages, the quality of the MC can be determined by the amount of effort , originality , and talent or skill that went into the creation of the content. For informational pages and pages on YMYL topics, accuracy and consistency with well established expert consensus is important. Effort : Consider the extent to which a human being actively worked to create satisfying content. Effort may be direct, such as a person translating a poem from one language to another. Effort may go into designing page functionality or building systems that power a webpage, such as the creation of a page that offers machine translation as a service to users. On the other hand, the automatic creation of thousands of pages by running existing freely available content through existing translation software without any oversight, manual curation, etc., would not be considered to have effort. For pages like social media posts or forum discussions, the level of participation and depth of conversation is an important part of effort. Contributions from multiple individuals on such pages can add up to a significant amount of total human effort. Originality : Consider the extent to which the content offers unique, original content that is not available on other websites. If other websites have similar content, consider whether the page is the original source. Talent or Skill : Consider the extent to which the content is created with enough talent and skill to provide a satisfying experience for people who visit the page. Accuracy : For informational pages, consider the extent to which the content is factually accurate. For pages on YMYL topics, consider the extent to which the content is accurate and consistent with well-established expert consensus. The purpose of the page, topic of the page, and type of website all play a role in how to evaluate the quality of the MC. For example, consistency with well-established expert consensus is important for medical advice. Skill is important for how-to videos. Talent and originality is important for artistic expression. The amount of effort expected for a short video shared on social media is less than for a full-length, professionally produced documentary on a streaming video website, but both need sufficient effort to create satisfying content for their purpose. Think about what effort, originality, talent, or skill looks like for the type of page that you are evaluating. For each page you evaluate, spend a few minutes examining the MC before drawing a conclusion about it. Read the article, watch the video, examine the pictures, use the calculator, play the online game, etc. Remember that MC also includes page features and functionality, so test the page out. For example, if the page is a product page on a store website, put at least one product in the cart to make sure the shopping cart is functioning. If the page is an online game, try to play the game yourself. Do your best to imagine that you are someone who's very interested in the topic, functionality, or purpose served by the page, then think about how satisfying the MC would be for that person. High and low quality MC comes in all formats (e.g., text, audio, video, images) and all lengths (e.g., short-form videos and full-length professional documentaries). High and low quality content also exists on all types of websites, from small personal sites to large corporate sites, from forums and social media to websites that handle financial transactions. Think carefully about what helps the page achieve its purpose and what makes the MC satisfying for users.  21

### Reputation of the Website and Content Creators

Reputation of the Website and Content Creators An important part of PQ rating is understanding the reputation of the website. If the website is not the primary creator of the MC, it’s important to research the reputation of the content creator as well. Reputation research should be performed according to the topic of the page. For example, if the page contains medical information, research the reputation of the website and content creator for providing medical information. It's possible for a website to be a go-to source for one type of content (e.g., humorous videos), but an untrustworthy source for a different type of content (e.g., financial information). A website's or content creator's reputation can also help you understand what a website or content creator is best known for. For example, newspapers may be known for high quality, independent investigative reporting while satire websites may be known for their humor. An individual journalist (content creator) may be known for the clarity of their scientific articles while a food blogger (content creator) may be known for the deliciousness of the recipes they post online. Note that a company or person may create content on many different websites. For example, a newspaper might have their own website, upload their video content to a video sharing website, post updates on social media, and contribute content to a TV channel. An expert on a topic might publish research papers, have a lengthy blog, and share short updates on social media. In these cases, you should research the underlying company or content creator. Reputation research is especially important for detecting untrustworthy websites and content creators. Content may look great on the surface, but reputation research can expose scams, fraud, or other signs of harm. You never know what you will find unless you look! Therefore, reputation research is required for all PQ rating tasks. 3.Reputation of the Website A website's reputation is based on the experience of real users and the opinions of people who are experts. Websites may represent real companies, organizations, and other entities. Reputation research applies to both the website and the actual company, organization, or entity that the website is representing. Many websites are eager to tell users how great they are. Your job is to independently evaluate the Page Quality of the website, not just accept information that appears on one or two pages of the website without further verification. Be skeptical of claims that websites make about themselves, particularly when there is a clear conflict of interest. Instead, look for independent reviews, references, recommendations by experts, news articles, and other sources of credible information about the website. Look for information written by a person or organization, not statistics or other machine-compiled information. News articles, Wikipedia articles, blog posts, magazine articles, forum discussions, and ratings from independent organizations can all be great sources of reputation information. For YMYL topics, the reputation of a website should be judged by what experts in the field have to say. Recommendations from expert sources, such as professional societies, are strong evidence of a positive reputation. Sources of reputation information will also vary according to the topic or type of company/organization/entity that the website represents. For example, you might find that a newspaper (with an associated website) has won journalistic awards. Prestigious awards or a history of high-quality original reporting are strong evidence of positive reputation for news websites. Note that some types of information about a website is not related to its reputation. For example, websites like Similarweb have information about Internet traffic to the website, but do not provide evidence of positive or negative reputation. You can ignore this type of information since it's not helpful for PQ rating.  

-  Customer Reviews as Reputation Information Customer reviews can be helpful for assessing the reputation of a store, business, or any website that offers products or services to users. You may consider a large number of detailed, trustworthy, positive user reviews as evidence of positive reputation for a store or business. However, you should interpret customer reviews with care, particularly if there are only a few. Keep the following in mind: 
  -- Be skeptical of both positive and negative reviews. Anyone can write them, including the website owner or someone whom the store or business hires for this purpose. 
  -- Try to find as many reviews as possible. Any store or business can get a few negative reviews—this is completely normal and expected. Large stores and companies receive thousands of reviews, and most receive some negative ones. 
  -- Read the reviews because the content of the reviews matter, not just the number or star rating. Credible, convincing reports of fraud and financial wrongdoing is evidence of extremely negative reputation. On the other hand, a single encounter with a rude clerk or the delayed receipt of a single package should not be considered negative reputation information. Please use your judgment. 3.How to Search for Reputation Information about a Website Here is how to research the reputation of the website: 1. Identify the “homepage” of the website. For example, for the IBM website, ibm.com is the homepage. You may need to identify the content creator, if it is different from that of the overall website. 2. Using ibm.com as an example, try one or more of the following searches on Google: 
  -- [ibm -site:ibm.com] - A search for IBM that excludes pages on ibm.com. 
  -- [“ibm.com” -site:ibm.com] - A search for “ibm.com” that excludes pages on ibm.com. 
  -- [ibm reviews -site:ibm.com] - A search for reviews of IBM that excludes pages on ibm.com. 
  -- [“ibm.com” reviews -site:ibm.com] - A search for reviews of “ibm.com” that excludes pages on ibm.com. Note : When searching for reputation information, try to find sources that were not written or created by the website or the company itself. For example, IBM might have official social media pages that it closely maintains, which would not be considered independent sources of reputation information about the company. See here for a Wikipedia article on identifying and using independent sources. 3. Look for articles, references, recommendations by experts, and other credible information written by people about the website. High quality news articles and informational articles may be good sources of reputation information. Search for such articles. For example, try [ibm site:en.wikipedia.org]. News articles and informational articles can help you learn about a company and may include information specific to reputation, such as awards and other forms of recognition, or also controversies and issues. Note that some informational articles include a message warning users that there are disagreements on some of the content, or that the content may be outdated. This may be an indication that additional research is necessary. 4. Make sure the information you find is appropriate for judging the reputation of the website. For example, reputation information for YMYL topics should come from sources that have expertise in the associated YMYL topic.  

-  Reputation of the Content Creators For individual authors and content creators, biographical information articles and online discussions can be a good source of reputation information. Expect to find more formal reputation information about people who create content in a journalistic, scientific, academic, or other traditionally professional capacity, as they often need online credibility for professional success. Educational degrees, peer validation, expert co-authors, and citations can be evidence of positive reputation information for professionals who publish their work. Employment history can also support a positive reputation for topics where training, credentials, or experience are important. Influencers and other individual content creators who earn income on social media platforms often have reputation information available as well, ranging from from biographical details or news articles to less formal reputation sources such as comments by other influencers in their fields. For non-professional content creators including ordinary people who post on social media or forums, you may find informal reputation information on the page itself such as comments by other people about the creators. For example, you may find comments or posts from other users helpful to see what other people think about a particular content creator. 3.What to Do When You Find No Reputation Information You should expect to find some reputation information for large websites and well-known content creators. People or businesses who create content in a professional capacity typically have some reputation information available. However, small websites may have little or no reputation information. This is not indicative of high or low quality. Many small local businesses or community organizations have a small “web presence” and rely on word of mouth. Furthermore, many ordinary people participate in forum discussions or post on social media websites in a personal capacity. People may use an alias or username to post in order to avoid sharing personally identifiable information online. There may be no reputation information available for some individuals. A lack of reputation about people who post personal content is neither a positive nor a negative sign in your assessment of the page. Finally, remember that there are several important considerations involved in PQ rating (refer back to Section ). Reputation is important, but if reputation information is not available for a website or content creator, pay extra attention to other PQ considerations, especially when assessing pages on YMYL topics.  25

#### Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust (E-E-A-T) Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trust (E-E-A-T)

  - Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust (E-E-A-T) Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trust (E-E-A-T) are all important considerations in PQ rating. The most important member at the center of the E-E-A-T family is Trust. Trust : Consider the extent to which the page is accurate, honest, safe, and reliable. The type and amount of Trust needed depends on the page, for example: 
    -- Online stores need secure online payment systems and reliable customer service. 
    -- Product reviews should be honest and written to help others make informed purchasing decisions (rather than solely to sell the product). 
    -- Informational pages on clear YMYL topics must be accurate to prevent harm to people and society. 
    -- Social media posts on non-YMYL topics may not need a high level of Trust, such as when the purpose of the post is to entertain its audience and the content of the post does not risk causing harm. Experience , Expertise and Authoritativeness are important concepts that can support your assessment of Trust: Experience : Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary first-hand or life experience for the topic. Many types of pages are trustworthy and achieve their purpose well when created by people with a wealth of personal experience. For example, which would you trust: a product review from someone who has personally used the product or a "review" by someone who has not? Expertise : Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary knowledge or skill for the topic. Different topics require different levels and types of expertise to be trustworthy. For example, which would you trust: home electrical rewiring advice from a skilled electrician or from an antique homes enthusiast who has no knowledge of electrical wiring? Authoritativeness: Consider the extent to which the content creator or the website is known as a go-to source for the topic. While most topics do not have one official, Authoritative website or content creator, when they do, that website or content creator is often among the most reliable and trustworthy sources. For example, a local business profile page on social media may be the authoritative and trusted source for what is on sale now. The official government page for getting a passport is the unique, official, and authoritative source for passport renewal. Experience , Expertise , and Authoritativeness may overlap for some page types and topics (for example, someone may develop Expertise in a topic due to first-hand Experience accumulated over time), and different combinations of E-E-A may be relevant to different topics. You should consider the purpose, type, and topic of the page, then ask yourself what would make the content creator a trustworthy source in that context.

  - Trust is the most important member of the E-E-A-T family because untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how Experienced, Expert, or Authoritative they may seem. For example, a financial scam is untrustworthy, even if the content creator is a highly experienced and expert scammer who is considered the go-to on running scams! When it comes to Page Quality rating, your assessment of E-E-A-T should be informed by one or more of the following: 
    -- What the website or content creators say about themselves: Look at the "About us" page on the website or profile page of the content creator as a starting point. Is the website or content creator a trustworthy source based on this information? 
    -- What others say about the website or content creators: Look for independent reviews, references, news articles, and other sources of credible information about the website or content creators. Is there independent, reliable evidence that the website or content creator is experienced, has expertise, is authoritative, or is otherwise considered trustworthy? Is there independent, reliable evidence that the website or creator is untrustworthy? 
    -- What is visible on the page, including the Main Content and sections such as reviews and comments: For some types of pages, the level of experience and expertise may be clear from the MC itself. What evidence can you gather from examining the MC or testing the page out? For example, you may be able to tell that someone is an expert in hair styling by watching a video of them in action (styling someone's hair) and reading others' comments (commenters often highlight expertise or lack thereof). Important : The website or content creator may not be a trustworthy source if there is a clear conflict of interest. For example, product reviews by people who own the product and share their experiences can be very valuable and trustworthy. However, "reviews" by the product manufacturer ( "Our product is great!" ) or "reviews" from an influencer who is paid to promote the product are not as trustworthy due to the conflict of interest. Finally, there are many aspects of Trust, some which are not captured by Experience, Expertise and Authoritativeness. Please consider other aspects in your overall Trust assessment, such as customer service information for online stores or peer-reviewed publications for academic authors. If a page is untrustworthy for any reason , it has low E-E-A-T.  

#### YMYL (Your Money Your Life) Topics

Experience or Expertise? Pages on YMYL topics can be created for a wide variety of different purposes. If the purpose of a page on a clear YMYL topic is to give information or offer advice, a high level of expertise may be required for the page to be trustworthy. However, sometimes pages on YMYL topics are created to share personal experiences, often regarding difficult life challenges. People turn to each other in times of need to share their own experience, seek comfort or inspiration, and learn from others. Factual information from experts and authoritative sources may not satisfy this need. Pages that share first-hand life experience on clear YMYL topics may be considered to have high E-E-A-T as long as the content is trustworthy, safe, and consistent with well-established expert consensus. In contrast, some types of YMYL information and advice must come from experts. Here are some examples: YMYL Topic Valuable sharing of life Experience Information or advice best left to Experts Sleep challenges when pregnant (YMYL Health or Safety) Safe and non-medical tips and tricks for sleeping in the last trimester of pregnancy, provided by people who have personally struggled with this challenge, for example: how to use pillows to sleep comfortably in a position that is safe for babies Sleep medications that are safe during pregnancy Liver cancer treatment (YMYL Health or Safety) A sincere and respectful forum discussion where people are describing how they're coping with liver cancer treatment Different treatment options for liver cancer and the associated life expectancies under each treatment Filling out tax forms (YMYL Financial Security) A humorous video from a non-expert content creator about the frustration of doing taxes Instructions on how to fill out tax forms Saving for retirement (YMYL Financial Security) Reviews of retirement saving services by people with first-hand experience using these services Advice on how to invest for retirement: how much to save, what kinds of assets to invest in, how much money you will need to retire by a specific age, etc. How to vote (YMYL Society) A social media post by an ordinary citizen describing why they personally believe it's important to vote in local elections Information about who is eligible to vote or how to register to vote  28

### Lowest Quality Pages

Lowest Quality Pages Lowest quality pages are untrustworthy, deceptive, harmful to people or society, or have other highly undesirable characteristics. The considerations for Lowest quality include quality of the MC, reputation, E-E-A-T, etc., but there are special checks you will need to complete first. As a reminder, here are the steps for doing PQ rating: 1. Assess the true purpose of the page. If the website or page has a harmful purpose or is designed to deceive people about its true purpose, it should be rated Lowest . 2. Assess the potential of the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines. Websites or pages that are harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as specified in these guidelines should receive the Lowest rating. 3. Otherwise, the PQ rating is based on how well the page achieves its purpose using the criteria outlined in these guidelines. Steps 1 and 2 are a screening process to quickly detect harmful content before other PQ considerations are applied. To identify Lowest quality pages, start by considering the following: Initial Consideration Lowest Quality Pages The purpose of the page The Lowest rating is required if the page has a harmful purpose, or if it is designed to deceive people about its true purpose or who is responsible for the content on the page. The Lowest rating is required if the page is created to benefit the owner of the website (e.g. to make money) with very little or no attempt to benefit website visitors or otherwise serve a beneficial purpose. The potential for the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines The Lowest rating is required if the MC is harmful to self or others, harmful to specified groups, or contains harmfully misleading information. The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for Lowest. Give special scrutiny to pages or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores, medical websites, or news coverage of major civic issues.  29

#### Hacked, Defaced, or Spammed Pages

- Next, assess the page to determine if any of the criteria for Lowest apply: Lowest Page Quality Assessment Any one of the following is justification for Lowest Quality of the MC 
  -- The page is hacked, defaced, or spammed. 
  -- The page is gibberish or otherwise makes no sense. 
  -- The MC is created with little to no effort, has little to no originality and the MC adds no value compared to similar pages on the web 
  -- The MC is created with so little effort, originality, talent, or skill that the page fails to achieve its purpose. The title of the page The page title is extremely misleading, shocking, or exaggerated. The role of Ads and SC on the page The MC is deliberately obstructed or obscured due to Ads, SC, interstitial pages, download links or other content that is beneficial to the website owner but not necessarily the website visitor. Information provided by the website and content creator A complete lack of information about who is responsible for the website and its content for YMYL pages or other pages requiring trust. Reputation of the website and content creator A very negative reputation, including a reputation for malicious or harmful behavior. Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T 
  -- The page or website is highly untrustworthy. 
  -- The lack of experience, expertise, authoritativeness or trust causes the page to fail to achieve its purpose.  30

##### Harmfully Misleading Information

- Harmfully Misleading Information Use the Lowest rating for pages that mislead people in ways that can cause harm to people and society. Misleading pages may have been produced with the intent to misinform people, or the content creator may believe that the inaccurate information they are sharing is true. There is an especially high standard for accuracy on clear YMYL topics or other topics where inaccurate information can cause harm. Be sure to research consequential facts or claims as necessary and to the extent the task time allows. Pages should be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information when they contain at least one of the following: Type of Harmfully Misleading Information Description Examples Harmful and clearly inaccurate information Content that can be refuted by straightforward and widely accepted facts 
  -- False claims that a world leader died 
  -- False dates for an election Harmful claims that contradict well-established expert consensus Content that is inconsistent with positions, facts, or findings that are widely agreed upon by authorities in the relevant field 
  -- Claims that lemons cure cancer 
  -- Claims that buying lottery tickets is a guaranteed way to save for retirement Harmful unsubstantiated theories/claims Content that is not grounded in any reasonable facts or evidence, especially those that could erode confidence in public institutions. This includes unsubstantiated theories that have been thoroughly debunked or are too outlandish to be given credence. 
  -- Claims that the 9-11 attacks were planned by the U.S. government 
  -- Claims that world leaders are lizard people Harmfully Misleading Information can occur from any websites or content creators - even seemingly "expert", "authoritative" or "official" ones. Any type of page with Harmfully Misleading Information should be rated Lowest, regardless of the source. However, note that some types of information are subjective, debatable, unverifiable, or inconsequential. For example, pages should not be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information if they exclusively contain: 
  -- Non-YMYL content created with a clear entertainment purpose, containing no hard claims of factual accuracy and are not harmful to people or society. Examples include many types of fiction, satire or parody, astrology, folklore, myths, and urban legends. 
  -- Reviews expressing personal preferences, opinions, or value-based judgments about a product, restaurant, book/movie/TV show, etc. 
  -- Claims or statements that are reasonably debatable when there is not a single established correct answer or truth (e.g., discussions about the relative effectiveness of different healthcare systems) 
  -- Insignificant errors or inaccurate information about a trivial topic (e.g., inaccuracies in the height of a celebrity) Pages that aim to persuade others that a certain position or perspective is correct are fairly common on the Internet. Pages with one-sided/opinionated/controversial/polarizing content should not be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information unless they could create harm to individuals or Specified Groups (as described above) and contain clearly inaccurate information, contradict well-established expert consensus, or are not grounded by reasonable facts/evidence. A webpage may be considered to have Harmfully Misleading Information based on the MC or on other characteristics of the page or information about the content creator (e.g., the title of an article is harmfully misleading, even if the article on its own is not; a creator blatantly misrepresenting their medical credentials for a video on medical topics). Harmfully Misleading Information can be especially hard to identify because it may require research from outside sources. Reputable fact-checking websites can't always keep up with the volume of unsubstantiated theories/claims produced by  34

- the Internet, and some theories may even claim that debunking information is inaccurate. You should attempt to find high-quality, trustworthy sources to check accuracy and seek out the consensus of experts if you are unsure. Please research theories and claims to the extent the task time allows. If a theory/claim seems wildly improbable and can't be verified by independent trustworthy sources, you should consider it unsubstantiated. Untrustworthy Webpages or Websites The Lowest rating should be used for pages or websites you strongly suspect are engaging in deceptive or malicious practices. Some untrustworthy pages are created to benefit the website or organization rather than helping people. Some untrustworthy pages may even exist to cause harm to people who engage with the page, such as scams or malicious downloads. Your assessment of untrustworthiness may be based on the content of the page, information about the website, information about the content creator, and the reputation of the website or content creator. Your assessment may also be based on a lack of critically important information. For example, any website involving financial transactions or sensitive information should have comprehensive information about who is responsible for the site and a way to contact the site if something goes wrong. If some aspect of a page or website makes you suspect deception or maliciousness, please look for information about the site. If you cannot find reputation information to confirm your suspicion, carefully explore the site. Sometimes a single page on an unknown website in isolation may seem odd but subsequent exploration shows no concern. However, if you see a pattern of what appears to be deception or manipulation or become concerned about your own safety, please use the Lowest rating and leave the website immediately. Pages with the following characteristics should be considered Untrustworthy: 
  -- Multiple or significant factual inaccuracies on an informational page which would cause users to lose trust in the webpage as a reliable source of information 
  -- Inadequate information about the website or content creator for its purpose 
  -- Lowest E-E-A-T or Lowest reputation 
  -- Deceptive purpose, deceptive page design, or deceptive intent 
  -- Deliberately obstructed or obscured MC 
  -- Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior 
  -- Any webpage or website designed to manipulate people into actions that benefit the website or other organization while causing harm to self, others, or Specified Groups Important : Highly untrustworthy pages should be given the Lowest rating even if you are unable to "prove" the webpage or site is harmful. Because many people are unwilling to use a highly untrustworthy page, an untrustworthy page or website fails to achieve its purpose. 4.Inadequate Information about the Website or Content Creator for the Purpose of the Page For pages that require a high level of trust, information about who created the content and who is responsible for the content is critical. As discussed in Section 2., we expect most websites to have some information about who (e.g., what individual, company, business, foundation, etc.) is responsible for the website and who created the MC and some contact information, unless there is a good reason for anonymity. As you will see in the examples below, many types of Lowest pages such as malicious downloads and scams typically have no information or fake information about who is responsible to prevent recourse by people who are harmed.  35

- Any site that handles personal, private or sensitive data must provide extensive contact information. This includes sites that ask users to create passwords, share personal information, or conduct financial transactions. YMYL pages or websites that handle sensitive data with absolutely no information about the website or content creator should be rated Lowest . 4.Lowest E-E-A-T and Lowest Reputation of the Website or Content Creator If the E-E-A-T of a page is low enough, people cannot or should not use the MC of the page. If a page on YMYL topics is highly inexpert, it should be considered Untrustworthy and rated Lowest . Use the Lowest rating if the website and content creator have an extremely negative reputation, to the extent that many people would consider the webpage or website untrustworthy. Here are some examples originally shown in Section 3.. All pages on these websites should be rated Lowest because of the credible extremely negative or malicious reputation of these websites, making them untrustworthy. Note : These website examples may be considered Harmful in some form as well. Sometimes reputation research exposes information that may not meet the criteria for considering a website harmful but does cause it to be untrustworthy. Website Description Site selling children’s jungle gym Evidence of fraudulent behavior : There are many reviews on websites describing how users sent money and did not receive anything in return. There is also a news article about this business engaging in financial fraud. Site selling products related to eyewear Evidence of criminal behavior : This website engaged in criminal behavior such as physically threatening users. Organization serving the hospitalized veteran community Evidence of fraudulent behavior : There are many detailed negative articles on news sites and charity watchdog sites describing fraud and financial mishandling about this organization. 4.Deceptive Page Purpose, Deceptive Information about the Website, Deceptive Design All pages or websites using deception of any type should be rated Lowest because they are Untrustworthy. Here are some types of deception to look for during Page Quality rating. Type of Deception Description Deceptive Purpose The page or the website superficially appear to have one purpose, but in fact exist for a different reason. Deceptive Information about the Website or Content Creators The website has deliberately inaccurate or misleading information about the website or content creators to make the website appear trustworthy. Deceptive Design The page or content is deliberately designed to look like one type of page or content but in fact functions as another. Note : No list of deceptive page types will be complete—deceptive websites continue to evolve as people and search engines figure out how they are being tricked.  36

- Content on a webpage may be "paraphrased" from another source. We will consider MC to be paraphrased if it contains content that is unoriginal and exists on other pages, with different wording, organization or phrasing. People can paraphrase content manually by rewriting the content from other sources using different words. Automated tools can also be used to create paraphrased content by restating or summarizing the content on other pages. Sometimes content is "embedded" or included on the page from another source. There is nothing wrong with embedding content, but the Lowest rating applies if there is no significant original content or added value on the page. Social media posts may be reposted by an unrelated account. There is nothing wrong with reposting content, but the Lowest rating applies if there is no added value in the form of additional content, context, or discussion. All of the following are considered copied or paraphrased content: 
  -- Content copied, reposted, or embedded exactly from an identifiable source. Sometimes an entire page is copied, and sometimes just parts of the page are copied. Sometimes multiple pages are copied and then pasted together into a single page. Content that has been copied, reposted, or embedded exactly is usually the easiest type of copied content to identify. 
  -- Content that is copied, but changed slightly from the original. This type of copying makes it difficult to find the exact matching original source. Sometimes just a few words are changed, or whole sentences are changed, or a “find and replace” modification is made, where one word is replaced with another throughout the text. Images may be cropped or videos may be segmented into shorter clips. These types of changes are deliberately done to make it difficult to find the original source of the content. We call this kind of content “copied with minimal alteration.” 
  -- Content copied from a changing source, such as a search results page or news feed. You often won't be able to find an exact matching original source if it is a copy of “dynamic” content (content that changes frequently). However, we will still consider this to be copied content. 
  -- Content that is paraphrased from a single source or multiple sources. Content from a single page or from many websites can be summarized, reworded or paraphrased by people or generative AI tools. Paraphrasing may be valuable, for example when an expert paraphrases the contents of a government policy in easy-to-understand language. Important : Copying, paraphrasing, embedding or reposting content does not automatically make a page Lowest quality. However, the Lowest rating is required when all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images, audio, videos, etc) is copied, paraphrased, embedded, or reposted with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors. Likewise, the use of Generative AI tools alone does not determine the level of effort or Page Quality rating. Generative AI tools may be used for high quality and low quality content creation. For example, a high level of effort may be involved in creating high quality original artwork using Generative AI tools. However, it's also possible to use Generative AI tools to create Lowest quality content with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors. 4.How to Determine if Content is Copied How do you determine whether all or most of the MC is copied? How do you identify the original source of the content? How do you know if content is paraphrased from a single page or from multiple pages? These things can be difficult to determine, but the following steps may help. 1. Copy a sentence or phrase in the text. It may be necessary to try a few sentences or phrases from the page just to be sure. When deciding what sentence or phrase to copy, try to find a sentence or series of several words without punctuation, unusual characters, or suspicious words that may have replaced the original text. 2. Search on Google by pasting the sentence or phrase (surrounded by quotation marks to search for an exact match) inside the Google search box. You may also try without quotation marks to search for more general matches.  43

- Use your best judgment. Sometimes it is clear that the content is copied or paraphrased from somewhere, but you cannot tell what the original source is. Other times the content found on the original source has changed enough that searches for sentences or phrases may no longer match the original source. For example, Wikipedia articles can change dramatically over time. Text copied from old copies may not match the current content. Summaries or paraphrased content may have a different organizational structure than the original source. If you strongly suspect the page you are evaluating is not the original source, consider it likely to be copied or paraphrased. Important : If all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images or videos) is copied, paraphrased, embedded, or reposted from other sources, you must assess the level of effort, originality and added value for website visitors in order to assign a rating. The Lowest rating is appropriate if there is little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors. The Low rating is appropriate if there is low effort, originality or added value to website visitors. Examples of Lowest Quality Pages Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation Lowest: Untrustworthy Untrustworthy 
  -- Multiple, obvious and odd factual inaccuracies 
  -- Lowest E-E-A-T This page appears to be an informational article about the animal the praying mantis. Factual inaccuracies and odd statements exist in the section titled “ Praying Mantises Are Not Poisonous ”: "In contrast to praying mollies, which are mostly solitary creatures that avoid human interaction, praying mollusks are more closely related to God. There are no poisonous snakes, and there are no venomous turtles." Odd, factually inaccurate and/or misleading statements: 
  -- The section suddenly refers to praying mantises as “praying mollies” - a name does that isn’t supported through a quick web search 
  -- Praying mollusks do not exist - there is no such animal 
  -- Statements about animals and their relation to God are not what one would expect on an informational page like this 
  -- Poisonous snakes exist It is unlikely a human author would make these odd statements and obvious mistakes. It's likely this content was auto-generated with no human editing. No matter how this content was created, the odd statements and factual inaccuracies make this article untrustworthy and therefore Lowest E-E-A-T and Lowest quality.  45

##### Lowest E-E-A-T and Deceptive Untrustworthy 
  -- This page has a deceptive purpose: the page claims to be an informational resource for parents, but the website terms of service state that it is published for AI enthusiasts and is not intended for the general public. 
  -- The website terms of use states that "some articles" are generated by artificial intelligence and may have errors or be out of date; there is no indication to which pages this statement applies.

The bottom of the page states "Our blog is dedicated to all things related to kids and parenting – including product reviews, news, recipes, and more. We strive to provide parents with the information they need in order to make informed decisions for their families." However, if you read the terms of service page, you'll find a very different description of pages on the website. The terms of use page states "Some articles on this website might have been partially generated by an artificial intelligence language model and published for experimental and research purposes. The articles on this website are only to be used as proof of concept by AI enthusiasts and not intended for general public. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the use or interpretation of this content for any other purpose than it was intended. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date . We recommend independently verifying the content and consulting with professionals for specific advice or information." Given the statements above, the articles on this website should be considered untrustworthy and Lowest E-E-A-T.

This page is on a YMYL topic. There is no information about who created this website, no contact information, and no information about the author. Medical pages require a high level of user trust. Because there is no information about who owns this website and who created this content, this is considered an untrustworthy website. Lowest: Merchant with little contact info, untrustworthy characteristics This looks like a product listing page on a merchant website. Untrustworthy 
  -- Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page 
  -- Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior Inaccurate information about shipping and returns, deceptive use of logos and no information about who is responsible make this shopping site appear potentially fraudulent and untrustworthy. This page is selling Nike Air Jordan shoes. However, there is inadequate contact information on the contact us page for a merchant site. In addition, the Shipping and Returns page has the name of another company that seems to be unrelated. There are also official looking logos at the bottom of the homepage, including the Better Business Bureau logo and Google Checkout logo, that don’t appear to be affiliated with the website.  49

The reputation of this website is lowest based on reports of malicious behavior. Lowest: Chicken recipes no MC This looks like a list of chicken recipes, but is actually a list of links that are ads. Untrustworthy, Spammy 
  -- No MC 
  -- Deceptive page design 
  -- Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors MC should be created to benefit people who come to the website. Pages without MC should be considered spammy as they crowd out and disincentivize the creation of pages with high quality MC. Pages with Ads that are designed to look like MC should be considered untrustworthy.  50

- Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation Lowest: Mesothelioma deceptive directory This page looks like a listing of resources about Mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer. Untrustworthy, Spammy 
  -- No MC 
  -- Deceptive page design 
  -- Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors Information about cancer could significantly impact how people make decisions related to medical treatment. This page is on a YMYL topic. This page is designed to look like a directory page or a list of helpful resources, but every link is an Ad. There is no MC on this page. Pages without MC should be considered spammy as they crowd out and disincentivize the creation of pages with high quality MC. Pages that disguise Ads as directory listings or other MC should be considered untrustworthy. Lowest: Ads deliberately obscure MC When you first visit the page, it appears that there is no MC, only Ads. If you scroll down, you will eventually find the MC at the bottom. Untrustworthy 
  -- Deliberately obstructed or obscured MC This page requires scrolling past so many Ads to get to the MC that many people may stop scrolling and leave the page before reaching the MC. Deliberately obscured MC to benefit the website with no help for people visiting the page should be considered untrustworthy. Lowest: Deceptive and untrustworthy fake survey page This page appears to be a survey with the opportunity to win an Apple MacBook Air, an iPhone 5c, or a Galaxy S4. Untrustworthy, Spammy 
  -- Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page

  -- Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors This page contains a fake survey, which appears to promise users the opportunity to win an Apple MacBook Air, an iPhone 5c, or a Galaxy S4. However, there is no information about who is responsible for the survey, even though upon clicking, the survey asks for highly personal information such as bank account numbers. The message at the top of the page, “Thank You from Goggle.com” and survey content could mislead users to think that the survey is affiliated with Google. This page is deceptive and should be considered untrustworthy.  51

- Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation Lowest: Lowest MC free credit report The title of the page suggests that it may provide a credit report from the government "freecreditreport gov". However, the page has gibberish MC and spammy looking features, such as ads or links surrounding the meaningless text. Untrustworthy, Spammy 
  -- Extremely misleading title 
  -- Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page 
  -- Deceptive page design 
  -- Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior 
  -- Cannot determine any purpose, e.g., gibberish MC 
  -- Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors Credit reports could significantly impact one’s financial security. This is a YMYL topic. The MC is gibberish. There is no beneficial purpose of gibberish MC. The title of the page is misleading, given the MC. This page also has deceptive features in the supplementary content, such as a friend request, a prize alert, and a download button. It is highly likely that these are ads or malicious download links. Lowest: Buy Xanax This is a page on the website for the U.S. Green Building Council. However, this page has the words "Buy Xanax" over and over again, along with related words about buying Xanax and a URL link. Untrustworthy, Spammy 
  -- Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior 
  -- Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors Prescription drugs could significantly impact a person’s health. This is a YMYL topic. This specific page has been created or modified on this organization's website in hopes that people will click on the link to buy the prescription drug Xanax. This is a spam technique. Spammers hope that the page will rank well in search results because the website is otherwise high quality. The words "buy xanax" are used repeatedly in hopes that the page will show up for the search "buy xanax". Attempting to spam search engines and trick people into clicking on links is highly untrustworthy behavior.  52

- Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation Lowest: Auto-generated bulldog wrinkle wipes This page claims to list the best bulldog wrinkle wipes and uses affiliate links. Untrustworthy, Spammy 
  -- Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page 
  -- Deceptive page design 
  -- Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors The MC on this page is copied with little or no time, effort, expertise, manual curation, or added value for users. Looking at the content at the bottom of the page and exploring other pages on the website, it is clear that each page is created automatically using content from Amazon and substituting different product names into a generic template. There appears to be little to no manual editing or curation on this page. The true purpose of this page is to bring users seeking information about products to this website in hopes that they will click and order products by clicking on Amazon affiliate links. This website does not have a beneficial purpose for users but rather was created to benefit the creator of the website. Though the website discloses that they use affiliate links, the site offers no added value for users. As with many deceptive websites, there is no information about who is responsible for this website. Lowest: Viagra copied content This looks like an information website for the drug Viagra. Untrustworthy, Spammy 
  -- Inadequate information about the website or content creator for the purpose of the page 
  -- Deceptive page design 
  -- Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors Information about prescription drugs could significantly impact a person’s health. This page is on a YMYL topic. All MC on this page is copied with little or no time, effort, expertise, manual curation, or added value for users. Here is the original source . Exploration of the pages on this website are similarly created with little expertise or added value for users. The true purpose of this page is to bring users seeking information about Viagra to this website in hopes that they will click on the “order now” link. The "order now" link goes to another website and is likely monetized. Therefore, this website does not have a beneficial purpose for users but rather was created to benefit another website. As with many deceptive websites, there is no information about who is responsible for this website.  54

- Webpage/Content Lowest Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation Lowest: Scaled content abuse cancers Spammy 
  -- Scaled content abuse 
  -- All of the MC on the page (including text, images or videos) is paraphrased with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors This page is a YMYL medical article. The contents of the page show it is created with generative AI with likely no original content and provides no value to users. For example, the article starts with "As a language model, I don’t have real-time data and my knowledge cutoff date is September 2021. Cancer rankings.." The end of the text of the article appears to be cut off with an incomplete sentence "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs): Pancreatic NETs are a rare type of pancreatic cancer that can have a poor" This is spam (scaled content abuse) and a highly untrustworthy medical page: it demonstrates no real expertise and may not be correct and is especially concerning for YMYL topics. Lowest: Scaled content abuse tumors Untrustworthy, Spammy 
  -- Scaled content abuse 
  -- Deceptive information about the website purpose 
  -- All of the MC on the page (including text, images or videos) is paraphrased or embedded with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors Website information indicates this is a website for rabbit enthusiasts "We are rabbit lovers and breeders, we will share some of our guides here, welcome to discuss with us." However the website includes articles on a very wide variety of topics unrelated to rabbits such as YMYL human health, making the information about the website appear deceptive. All the MC on the page is embedded from a different source or likely paraphrased and unoriginal. If you explore the site, you'll find hundreds of templated articles with unoriginal, paraphrased content and embedded videos. This is an example of scaled content abuse. While the method of content creation is unknown, the format of the articles (question and answer) is a common technique to create scaled content by collecting questions (available from sources such as Google Search's "People also ask" feature ) and answering the questions with unoriginal, paraphrased content (often using generative AI tools).  55

- Low Quality Pages Low quality pages do not achieve their purpose well because they are lacking in an important dimension or have a problematic aspect. Low quality pages do not meet the standards for Lowest but may have similar though milder undesirable characteristics. To identify Low quality pages, start by considering the following: Initial Consideration Low Quality Pages The purpose of the page Low quality pages have a beneficial or non-harmful purpose. The potential for the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines Low quality pages have either no potential to cause harm, or have some mild potential for harm but do not meet the standards for Lowest as described in Section . The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for Low. Give special scrutiny to pages or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores, medical websites, or news coverage of major civic issues. Next, assess the page to determine if any of the criteria for Low apply: Low Page Quality Assessment Any one of the following is justification for Low Quality of the MC MC is created without adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill necessary to achieve the purpose of the page in a satisfying way. The title of the page The page title is slightly misleading, shocking, or exaggerated. The role of Ads and SC on the page The Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of the MC as described in Section . Information provided by the website and content creator Unsatisfying amount of website information or information about the content creator for the purpose of the page. Important : For personal content shared on social media platforms or forums, an alias or username is adequate. Reputation of the website and content creator A mildly negative reputation of the website or content creator. Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T Inadequate level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page. Important : Low quality pages can occur on any type of website, including academic websites, nonprofit websites, government websites, or any other generally helpful type of website. Low quality pages may be about any topic. Pages on YMYL topics need more scrutiny for signs of Low quality related to the MC and website/content creator because the page could impact a person’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society. However, for any type of page, a single Low quality attribute is enough to use the Low quality rating.  59

- Lacking E-E-A-T Low quality pages often lack an appropriate level of E-E-A-T for the topic or purpose of the page. Here are some examples: 
  -- The content creator lacks adequate experience, e.g. a restaurant review written by someone who has never eaten at the restaurant 
  -- The content creator lacks adequate expertise, e.g. an article about how to skydive written by someone with no expertise in the subject 
  -- The website or content creator is not an authoritative or trustworthy source for the topic of the page, e.g. tax form downloads provided on a cooking website. 
  -- The page or website is not trustworthy for its purpose, e.g. a shopping page with minimal customer service information Important: The Low rating should be used if the page lacks appropriate E-E-A-T for its purpose. No other considerations such as positive reputation or the type of website can overcome a lack of E-E-A-T for the topic or purpose of the page. Low Quality Main Content MC is Low quality if it is created without adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill necessary to achieve the purpose of the page in a satisfying way. Mild inaccuracies on informational pages are evidence of Low quality. However, if the page has harmful inaccuracies or so many inaccuracies that it feels untrustworthy, the Lowest rating is justified. Here are some examples of pages with Low quality MC: Low Quality MC Examples Why the MC is considered Low quality A crafting tutorial page with instructions on how to make a basic craft and lots of unhelpful "filler" at the top, such as commonly known facts about the supplies needed or other non-crafting information. Lacks adequate effort to clearly present the instructions to people hoping to make the craft. A list of the best vacuum cleaners with product images and reviews that are paraphrased or summarized from other sources, with minimal signs of effort or original content added by the content creator. Lacks adequate effort and first-hand experience from the content creator. A slide show of the top 10 world destinations using other people's pictures and existing top 10 lists. Lacks effort and originality. A page titled "How many centimeters are in a meter?" with a large amount of off-topic and unhelpful content such that the very small amount of helpful information is hard to find. Lacks effort, has excessive filler, lacks depth, and has only commonly known facts. A list of the tallest mountains in the world that is missing Mount Everest. Lacks accuracy and effort. The title of the page is also considered part of the MC. Titles are important because they represent the page in search results and help users decide what to click on. A misleading title can lead to a poor search experience. Exaggerated or shocking titles are evidence of Low quality because of the poor user experience that results when users see the actual MC after reaching the page.  60

- customer opinions and experiences, and read the details of negative reviews and low ratings before inferring that the business overall has a negative reputation. A few negative customer service reviews are typical for businesses such as stores or restaurants. Unsatisfying Amount of Information about the Website or Content Creator Expect to find some form of website information for many or most websites. We expect clear information about who (e.g., what individual, company, business, foundation, etc.) created the MC, unless there is good reason for anonymity. A long-standing Internet alias or username can identify the content creator. For personal websites or forum discussions on non-YMYL topics, an email address or social media link alone may be sufficient. Many people are reasonably hesitant to share personally identifiable information online! Stores and websites that process financial transactions require a high level of user trust. If a store or financial transaction website has just an email address and physical address, it may be difficult to get help if there are issues with the transaction. Likewise, many other types of websites on clear YMYL topics also require a high level of user trust. Important : Pages that offer payment functionality or process other types of financial transactions should receive a Low rating if there is an unsatisfying amount of customer service information or contact information. Pages on YMYL topics and other pages that require a high level of user trust should receive a Low rating if there is an unsatisfying amount of information about who is responsible for the website or who created the content. For forums, social media pages, and other websites where people commonly exchange opinions, a username is an acceptable identifier. Exaggerated or Mildly Misleading Information about the Website or Content Creator Recall that deceptive information about a website or content creator is a strong reason for the Lowest rating. However, sometimes the information about the website or content provider seems exaggerated or mildly misleading, such as claims of personal experience or expertise that seem overstated or included just to impress website visitors. E-E-A-T assessments should be based on the MC itself, the information you find during reputation research, verifiable credentials, etc, not just website or content creator claims of "I'm an expert!". If you find the information about the website or the content creator to be exaggerated or mildly misleading, the Low rating should be used.  63

- Examples of Low Quality Pages Type of Webpage/Content Low Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation Low: News 1 Article about nuclear power 
  -- Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well 
  -- MC lacks accuracy or does not align with well-established expert consensus 
  -- Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page Information about energy sources and nuclear power could significantly impact global industries and society. This is a YMYL topic. The writing of this article is unprofessional, including many grammar and punctuation errors. The MC also appears to have been paraphrased from a science article found on a different source, but with factual inaccuracies introduced throughout. The combination of low quality MC and lack of E-A-T justify the Lowest+ to Low rating. Low: News 2 Article titled "Getting Rid Of Toxins After The Holiday Season" 
  -- Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well 
  -- MC lacks accuracy or does not align with well-established expert consensus 
  -- Slightly misleading, shocking, or exaggerated title 
  -- Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page The title of the article is misleading and does not reflect the actual content of the page. The MC does not explain how to get rid of toxins or what the word "toxins" in the headline refers to. The content also has many problems: the writing quality is poor, and the article includes meaningless statements such as "water therapy is one of the easiest ways of beauty regimen since it will give enough moisture on the skin". The article fails to cite sources, and there is no evidence of E-A-T. Low: Informational 40th birthday party food ideas 
  -- Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well 
  -- Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of MC 
  -- Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page This page and website have many characteristics of Low quality pages. Close observation shows MC that contains mostly commonly known information and poor quality writing, demonstrating a lack of effort. The MC is broken up by large Ads that significantly disrupt the user experience. Low: Article 1 Article with tips for dressing for the office 
  -- Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well 
  -- Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page This informational article has multiple Low quality characteristics leading to a Low or Lowest+ rating. There is a large amount of "filler" or meaningless content and a complete lack of effort in editing. In addition, the MC contains only commonly known information with no expertise or first-hand experience shared by the content creator.  64

- Type of Webpage/Content Low Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation Low: Article 2 Using ginger for your health 
  -- Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well 
  -- MC lacks accuracy or does not align with well-established expert consensus 
  -- Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page This informational article has multiple Low quality characteristics leading to a Low or Lowest+ rating. There is garbled or meaningless content, a complete lack of effort in editing, and unrelated links in the middle of the page. Additionally, the article is on a health topic, and there are no signs that the content creator has relevant expertise or links to support the medical claims made in the article. Low: Article 3 How to adopt children from Iraq 
  -- Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well 
  -- Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page Adopting a child significantly impacts the health and well-being of families. This is a YMYL topic. However, the steps listed here are merely commonly-known information that would be of little benefit to someone interested in adopting a child from Iraq. For example, step 1 says “Choose an adoption agency” and suggests looking in a phone book. This demonstrates a lack of effort in the creation of MC. There is almost no information specific to Iraq. There is no evidence of expertise on adoption from the description about the author. Note that some Ads have the same format as links to other articles on this website, potentially making it a bit harder for users to visually distinguish these Ads from the MC and SC. Low: Article 4 
  -- MC has low effort, low originality and little added value compared to the original source This page summarizes a discussion page . There is little original content. It requires low effort to summarize a discussion. This page offers little added value over the original source.  65

- Type of Webpage/Content Low Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation Low: Financial Page with advice on picking a quality stock for investment 
  -- Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page Advice on stock investment could significantly impact a person’s financial decisions and security. This is a YMYL topic. The MC is superficial and includes mostly commonly known information for this topic, e.g. "look at key statistics" or "find companies with rising revenue". There is no evidence that the author has financial expertise. Because this article gives advice on a YMYL financial topic, lacking expertise is a reason for a Low rating. Low: Medical Page with information about how long the flu lasts 
  -- Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page Many patient hospitalizations and deaths occur due to the flu each year. This topic could significantly impact a person’s health. This is a YMYL topic. There is no evidence that the author has medical expertise. Because this article gives advice on a YMYL medical topic, lacking expertise is a reason for a Low rating. Low: Recipe 1 Apple pie recipe 
  -- Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well This page and website have many characteristics of Low quality pages. The MC is low quality and lacks important information. For example, it gives no indication of how to make a crust and doesn’t list premade crust as an ingredient. It would be very difficult to actually make an apple pie using this recipe. This page is lacking the kind of helpful content we expect in recipe pages, such as user reviews or comments. Without such information, it’s hard to tell if the recipe is any good. The small pink text at the top is not helpful for users. Low: Recipe 2 Gluten-free New York cheesecake recipe 
  -- Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of MC This is an example of distracting and disruptive Ads/SC: there are large Ads in the main column pushing down the MC as well as highly distracting content on the right that are labeled “Top Posts & Pages.” It is unclear whether these are SC or Ads. Additionally, the images in the Ads/SC are shocking, racy, and completely unrelated to the MC, which creates a poor user experience.  66

- Medium Quality Pages Medium pages have a beneficial purpose and achieve their purpose. There is nothing wrong with Medium quality pages. Expect to encounter many Medium quality pages in PQ rating tasks. To identify Medium quality pages, start by considering the following: Initial Consideration Medium Quality Pages The purpose of the page Medium quality pages have a beneficial or non-harmful purpose. The potential for the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines Medium quality pages are not expected to cause harm. The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for Medium. Give special scrutiny to pages on YMYL topics or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores. The title of the page Medium quality pages have titles that summarize the page. The role of Ads and SC on the page The Ads and SC do not block or significantly interfere with the MC on Medium quality pages. Remember : Many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration for PQ rating. Information provided by the website and content creator Medium quality pages have adequate information about the website and content creator for the purpose of the page. For stores or websites that process financial transactions, examine the customer service information. Important: For personal content shared on social media platforms or forums, an alias or username is adequate.

Reputation of the website and content creator Not especially positive nor especially negative: Reputation information found about the website or content creator is not concerning, but not positive enough to justify a higher rating. Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T Adequate level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page.  68

- Types of Medium Quality Pages There are two types of Medium quality pages: Type of Medium Page Description Nothing wrong, but nothing special All of the Medium Page Quality considerations and criteria apply. Mixed, but with some redeeming qualities The page or website has some signs of High quality (E-E-A-T, quality of the MC, positive reputation), but also has one sign or mild signs of Low quality. Important: For a page to receive a rating higher than Medium , it must meet the criteria described in the next sections on High and Highest page quality. For a page to receive a rating lower than Medium , it must meet the criteria for Low or Lowest page quality. Medium is a rating that applies to many pages you will encounter in PQ rating tasks: many pages have nothing wrong, yet do not represent the high or highest quality content that's available online. Examples of Medium Quality Pages Webpage/Type of Content Medium Quality Justification PQ Rating and Explanation Medium: Encyclopedia Wikipedia article about baroque pearls Nothing wrong, but nothing special 
  -- Adequate MC: achieves the purpose of the page This is a short Wikipedia article about baroque pearls, a fairly narrow topic.

Medium: Humor Page from a humorous site Nothing wrong, but nothing special 
  -- Adequate MC: achieves the purpose of the page This page is from a humorous site that encourages users to post photos with mouths drawn on them.

- High Quality Main Content High quality MC should be satisfying for people visiting the page. High quality MC shows evidence of effort, originality, talent, or skill. For informational pages, High quality MC must be accurate and consistent with well-established expert consensus when such consensus exists. Have high standards! If you aren't sure whether the content is high quality, try finding other pages on the same topic to help calibrate your assessment: "typical" and "average" pages on a topic generally have Medium (not High) quality MC.

  -- The MC allows the page to achieve its purpose well because the content creator has talent or skill, e.g. a how-to article on plumbing by a skilled plumber Low level of talent or skill 
  -- A lack of adequate talent or skill prevents the page from achieving its purpose, e.g. a how-to article on plumbing by someone who does not have the necessary skill to explain the steps accurately Positive Reputation Positive reputation of the website can be a reason for a High rating if the website is responsible for the MC. If the website is not responsible for the MC (e.g., posts on social media websites or forums), positive reputation of the content creator(s) can be a reason for the High rating. For non-YMYL topics, reputation information may be less formal. Popularity, user engagement, and user reviews can be considered evidence of reputation for non-YMYL websites: websites can be considered to have a positive reputation if they are popular and well-known for their topic or content type. Remember: Many smaller websites and ordinary people have little reputation information available. A page can still receive a High rating without reputation information.  72

- High Level of E-E-A-T Depending on the purpose of the page, topic, and type of website, a high level of E-E-A-T may be required for the page to achieve its purpose well and be considered High quality. Pages with High E-E-A-T are trustworthy or very trustworthy. Experience is valuable for almost any topic. Social media posts and forum discussions are often High quality when they involve people sharing their experience. From writing symphonies to reviewing home appliances, first-hand experience can make a social media post or discussion page High quality. Expertise is required for satisfying content on a variety of topics, from hobbies such as photography to YMYL topics such as tax preparation. Think about the topic of the page and what expertise is needed to create satisfying, trustworthy content. There are many types of informal expertise that may be visible in the MC itself. Authoritative pages of all types can be found. Government tax websites are an authoritative source for tax forms. Local businesses and organizations may be go-to sources for local information. When looking at a page or website, consider whether it is considered a go-to, authoritative source for the type of information it is displaying. Trust is especially important for High quality pages that involve processing financial transactions or cover YMYL topics. Even if the topic is not YMYL, trust may still be required; for example, product reviews and pages offering advice require at least some level of trust. While not all pages require a high level of trust, a trustworthy page is often a satisfying one. Think about the topic of the page. What kind of E-E-A-T is required for the page to achieve its purpose well?  73

- Highest Quality Pages Highest quality pages serve a beneficial purpose and achieve that purpose very well. The distinction between High and Highest is based on the quality of MC, the reputation of the website and content creator, and/or E-E-A-T. To identify Highest quality pages, start by considering the following: Initial Consideration Highest Quality Pages The purpose of the page Highest quality pages have a beneficial purpose. The potential for the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines Highest quality pages are not expected to cause harm. The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for Highest. Give special scrutiny to pages on YMYL topics or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores. The title of the page Highest quality pages have titles that summarize the page. The role of Ads and SC on the page The Ads and SC do not block or significantly interfere with the MC on HIghest quality pages. Remember : Many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration for PQ rating. Information provided by the website and content creator Highest quality pages have adequate information about the website and content creator for the purpose of the page. For stores or websites that process financial transactions, examine the customer service information. Important: For personal content shared on social media platforms or forums, an alias or username is adequate. Next, assess the page to determine if the criteria for Highest apply: Highest Page Quality Assessment Highest Quality Pages must demonstrate at least one of the following Quality of the MC MC created with a very high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill such that the page achieves its purpose very well. Reputation of the website and content creator Very positive reputation of the website for the topic of the page. Very positive reputation of the content creator for the topic of the MC. Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T Very high level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page.  77

- Very High Quality MC Very high quality MC should be highly satisfying for people visiting the page. Very high quality MC shows evidence of a high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill. For informational pages, very high quality MC must be accurate, clearly communicated, and consistent with well-established expert consensus when it exists. Very high quality MC represents some of the most outstanding content on a topic or type that's available online. The standards for Highest quality MC may be very different depending on the purpose, topic, and type of website. Here are some examples of Highest quality original content: 
  -- For news : Original reporting that provides information that would not otherwise have been known had the article not revealed it. Accurate, original, in-depth, and investigative reporting requires a high level of skill/talent and effort. Very high quality news content will include a description of primary sources and other original reporting referenced during the content creation process. Very high quality news content must be accurate and should meet professional journalistic standards. 
  -- For artistic content (videos, images, photography, writing, etc.): Unique and original content created by highly skilled and talented artists or content creators. Such artistic content requires a high level of skill/talent and effort. If the artistic content is related to a YMYL topic (e.g., artistic content with the purpose of informing or swaying opinion about YMYL topics), YMYL standards should apply. 
  -- For informational content: Original, accurate, comprehensive, clearly communicated, and should reflect expert consensus as appropriate. Expectations for different types of information may vary. For example, scientific papers have a different set of expectations than a social media post sharing information about a hobby such as stamp collecting. However, all types of very high quality informational content share common characteristics of accuracy and clarity of communication, in addition to meeting standards appropriate to the topic or field. The Highest rating may be justified for pages with very satisfying MC created with a very high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill. Very Positive Reputation Reputation research is important when giving Highest ratings. For YMYL topics, very positive reputation is often based on recommendations from known experts or professional societies appropriate to the topic of the page. Prestigious awards may be evidence as well, depending on the topic and type of content. For non-YMYL topics, reputation information may be less formal. Popularity, user engagement, and user reviews can be considered evidence of reputation for non-YMYL websites: websites and content creators can be considered to have a very positive reputation if they are seen as one of the best sources available online for a topic or type of content. Remember: Many smaller websites and ordinary people have little reputation information. A page can still receive a Highest rating without reputation information. Very High Level of E-E-A-T Very high E-E-A-T is a distinguishing factor for Highest quality pages. A website or content creator who is the uniquely authoritative, go-to source for a topic has very high E-E-A-T. A content creator with a wealth of experience may be considered to have very high E-E-A-T for topics where experience is the primary factor in trust. A very high level of expertise can justify a very high E-E-A-T assessment. Very high E-E-A-T websites and content creators are the most trusted sources on the internet for a particular topic. Think about what E-E-A-T means for the topic of the page. How important is first-hand experience? Who are the experts? What makes a source highly authoritative for the topic? What makes a website or content creator trustworthy for the topic? Standards for very high E-E-A-T will differ depending on the topic of the page.  78

- Page Quality Criteria for Specific Types of Pages Ratings for Encyclopedia Pages There are many encyclopedia-type websites. Some are highly-respected publications that are standard references, while some are websites with content created and edited by anonymous users, with no editorial oversight or fact checking. We may not always know the author of the specific encyclopedia article, and therefore must rely on website reputation research to determine the E-E-A-T of the article. High and Highest quality ratings should only be used for encyclopedias with very good reputations for accuracy and expertise, where the article itself is well-researched with appropriate references cited. A note about Wikipedia: in general, the website has a good reputation and is a very popular resource that is generally valued for accuracy. However, there is no single author or organization that vouches for the accuracy of Wikipedia articles, and the quality of pages varies. You should check individual articles to evaluate the quality of the MC. A Wikipedia article on a non-YMYL topic ( example ) with a satisfying amount of accurate information and trustworthy external references can usually be rated in the High range. A PQ rating in the Medium range is often appropriate for pages with less extensive MC and external references. Naturally, Wikipedia articles with very little MC should get lower PQ ratings. Factual inaccuracy is a sufficient reason for a Low or Lowest rating. Ratings for Pages with Error Messages or No MC In PQ rating tasks, you may encounter pages with error messages or other types of "broken" pages. Please think about whether the page offers help for users—did the website owner make an effort to ensure that users visiting the page have a good experience and get help finding what they are looking for? Pages with an explicit error (or custom 404) message are often Medium quality, since they tend to clearly communicate that there's a problem and help users navigate to other/better pages on the website. A rating of High (or occasionally even Highest ) may be used for the rare error message page that involves a high level of effort and original content and provides a truly satisfying experience for users. Pages that are "broken" are often Low quality, because the broken aspect prevents them from achieving their purpose even if the problem is temporary and likely to be fixed later on by the website owner. However, sometimes "broken" pages should be rated Lowest if the problem is not temporary and instead is due to a systemic problem with the website. To differentiate between Low quality (temporarily broken) vs. Lowest quality (evidence of a systemic problem) pages, check other pages on the same website. If many other pages have the same problem, there is a systemic lack of effort on the part of the website owner that justifies the Lowest rating. Otherwise, use the Low rating to reflect the (hopefully temporary!) issue with the MC on the page. Here are some examples: Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation Lowest: Deliberately created with no MC (systemic problem) 
  -- No MC 
  -- Content created with little to no effort, little to no originality, and little to no added value for website visitors This is an example of a page with no MC. You might think that the MC is “missing” due to a problem with this particular page, but in fact, this website has hundreds of pages that look the same—no MC, just Ads. This website shows Ads with little or no attempt to help users, and should be rated Lowest quality.  85

- Ratings for Forums and Q&A Pages Ratings for forum and Q&A pages can be challenging. Here is some guidance on how to approach these pages: 
  -- The Main Content includes the question, the answers/responses, and the resulting discussions. 
  -- Rate from the point of view of a user who visits the page , rather than a participant involved in the discussion. 
  -- Users who post answers/responses or comments are often identified only by a username or alias. A page can be High or Highest quality with just usernames or aliases depending on other criteria. 
  -- The E-E-A-T of a discussion among users can often be judged by the posts or comments themselves. ○ For some topics, Experience is the most important dimension of Trust. For other topics, assessing Expertise through the posts may be important. In some cases, the posters themselves will highlight either their own Experience or Expertise, or other people will comment on it. ○ Pages on YMYL topics require more attention to Trust and more care in the assessment of E-E-A-T. 
  -- Highest quality forum/Q&A pages have extremely satisfying conversations, including participation from users who have put a great deal of effort into their posts and have a wealth of Experience and/or Expertise on the topic. Such conversations can be very satisfying because of the depth of discussion, the unique insights, or the sharing of experiences that many would not have access to in their real-world community. 
  -- Low quality forum/Q&A pages often lack effort (few responses, surface-level rather than in-depth discussion), lack Experience or Expertise, contain mild inaccuracies, or show a significant lack of respect or decorum among the participants that might deter others from joining the discussion. 
  -- Lowest quality forum/Q&A pages may contain information or advice that is harmfully misleading, contradicts well-established expert consensus, encourages harm towards self or other individuals/participants, etc. One challenge is rating pages with little to no participation, and/or no answer to an open question: 
  -- A new page or recently started discussion that consists only of a question or initial post by a person should generally be rated Medium unless there are other low quality attributes. These pages may need time to achieve their purpose. 
  -- Over time, no participation in a discussion (or only superficial discussion) and/or no meaningful answer to an open question may be a reason for a Low quality rating, especially in the presence of other low quality attributes. Another challenge occurs when the discussion on the page drifts, becomes combative, or becomes dominated by misleading or spammy content. When rating, value the insightful, meaningful discussion that exists. If the page is a mix of high and low quality characteristics but has insightful, meaningful discussion, the Medium rating may be most appropriate as long as the page is not potentially harmful. Here are some examples:  87

- Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation Lowest: Q&A page about chest pains and smoking 
  -- Harmfully Misleading Information: Contains inaccurate and potentially dangerous medical advice about a YMYL topic Information about chest pain and smoking could significantly impact people’s decisions to seek medical treatment. This page is on a YMYL topic. This page must be evaluated from the point of view of a user visiting this page from a search engine, rather than a participant. The question is poorly worded and difficult to understand. There aren't many responses. One response correctly warns about the danger of smoking cigarettes but suggests smoking marijuana instead. Another response suggests that it's fine to keep smoking and that aspirin can be used to address pain. The last response lacks respect: it asks if the person who asked the original question is stupid. The answers have incorrect and potentially dangerous medical advice, making it lowest quality MC. Low: Q&A page about a 2002 Volvo part 
  -- Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well 
  -- Misleading page design Please read the MC (areas with red boxes around it), including the completely unhelpful "answer." This answer is so unhelpful, we can consider this question to be unanswered. This page has an unsatisfying amount of MC. In addition to a very unhelpful “answer,” the page design makes it difficult to distinguish the MC from Ads. For example, below the answer, we see a "sponsored answer," which has the same format as the real answer, but is actually an Ad and not an answer to the question—this is a misleading page design. Medium: Forum page with a new question, posted by a person Nothing wrong, nothing special 
  -- Real in-depth question, posted very recently 
  -- No one has responded (yet) Forums rely on user engagement to create satisfying MC. In this case, a real person has posted a question that can lead to good discussion. The question is only hours old (at the time this example was created). For new questions, discussions and threads, a Medium rating is appropriate if there are no low quality characteristics but also no opportunity for discussion yet.  88

- Webpage/Type of Content Characteristics of the Page PQ Rating and Explanation Medium: Forum page on an online auction website Mixed, but with some redeeming qualities: 
  -- High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page 
  -- Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well The relative lack of effort/participation in the discussion and depth of the MC is balanced by the high E-E-A-T of this forum. This forum is dedicated to this kind of question and therefore has a high level of expertise. Medium: Forum page on how to wash ballet shoes Mixed, but with some redeeming qualities: 
  -- Adequate MC: achieves the purpose of the page 
  -- Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of MC 
  -- High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page This forum is about dance topics, and many pages have expertise from a community of ballet dancers. On this particular page, participants have first-hand experience washing ballet shoes and make recommendations based on their own experiences. This page is “mixed” because there is some distracting content that makes it hard to read the MC. However, this is not a beauty contest! Even though the page may be cluttered, there is some valuable E-E-A-T and helpful MC, making Medium a good rating for this page. High: Forum post on the magic loop technique in knitting 
  -- MC is satisfying for the purpose of the page: demonstrates effort, originality, talent, or skill 
  -- High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page The person who posted the first message on this forum page provides a helpful resource on how to master the magic loop technique in knitting (effort, skill). She also shares pictures of her own version using an old pair of blue jeans (original content). With over 20 years of experience knitting socks, we would consider her to be an expert on the topic. High: Q&A page about whether a Roomba will work 
  -- Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of the page well 
  -- High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page Many participants share their personal experiences with these products, giving details such as how well certain models work with pet hair (effort, first-hand experience, original content). There are many descriptions of participants’ own experiences with this product and how well it works for them, making the MC satisfying for the purpose of the page.  89

The quality of the MC is high due to the level of effort, skill, and engagement among those who participate in the forum. While there is an ad at the top and a few ads within the forum message, it does not distract from the MC, which is easy to find. High: Forum page on landscaping an aquarium 
  -- Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of the page well 
  -- High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page This discussion focuses on the landscaping for a particular paludarium (an aquarium with terrestrial and aquatic elements).

-  Page Quality Rating Tasks At first, PQ rating may seem difficult. There are several aspects of the page and the website to look at and think about. Important : Do not struggle with each PQ rating. Please give your best rating and move on. If you are having trouble deciding between two ratings, use the lower rating. If you are torn between three ratings, choose the one in the middle. Do not consider the country or location of the page or website for PQ rating. For example, English (US) raters should use the same PQ standards when rating pages from other English language websites (UK websites, Canadian websites, etc.) as they use when rating pages from U.S. websites. In other words, English (US) raters should not lower the PQ rating because the page location (UK, Canada) does not match the task location. These guidelines are specific to "regular" webpages. Occasionally, you may be asked to rate a landing page that is not a webpage. For example, you may be asked to rate a PDF file, a PNG or JPEG image file, etc. When the landing page of the URL is not a webpage, some of the criteria in these guidelines may not apply. In this case, please use your judgment. Finally, this Page Quality Rating Guideline does not completely cover every aspect of page quality. If you find pages that you truly believe to be High or Low quality, please rate them as such, even if the reason is based on something not covered in these guidelines. Please use the comment section to explain your reasoning. As always, use your judgment. 1

-  Instructions for Rating Page Quality Tasks The Page Quality task page is broken up into several parts: 1. Some initial questions about the task landing page. 2. A “PQ grid” to record your observations about PQ characteristics of the landing page. 3. The Overall PQ rating slider which records your Overall PQ rating. 4. A comment box to explain your rating. Some results to the initial questions will end the task early. If the page is Porn, Foreign Language, Did Not Load, or consists of restricted or inaccessible MC (e.g., subscription is required to view MC), you will not fill in the PQ grid or assign an overall rating. 
  -- Foreign Language should not be used when the language on the landing page is in the task language, a language that is commonly used by a significant percentage of the population in the task location, or English. 
  -- Did Not Load should be used for pages where there is absolutely no content on the page created by the website. There is no MC, SC, or Ads on the page. See this Wikipedia article for descriptions of different types of error messages. The PQ grid is designed to be your "note pad." It allows you to record your observations about the landing page and the website it belongs to.  91

- Page Quality Rating FAQs Question Answer Why do we have to do all these steps? This takes a long time! With practice, the amount of time needed for accurate PQ ratings will decrease. The steps are important and are designed to help you assess many different aspects of PQ. You may be surprised by what you find. Pages that initially look Low quality may turn out to be Medium or High quality with careful inspection. The reverse may happen as well. We want your most informed, thoughtful opinion. Are we just giving High quality ratings to pages that “look” good? No! The goal is to do the exact opposite. These steps are designed to help you analyze the page without using a superficial “does it look good?” approach. Is sharing a personal experience or opinion a beneficial purpose? What if the personal opinion is upsetting or offensive? Sharing a personal experience or opinion can be a beneficial purpose as it allows people to appreciate different perspectives. Content on the Internet can help people understand why others think and feel the way they do. It can be valuable to see the opinions and perspectives of others, even when they are off-putting, distasteful, upsetting, or offensive to you personally. Apply the standards of these guidelines rather than your own personal opinions or views. However, sometimes opinions and perspectives can spread misleading information or otherwise have the potential to cause harm. Therefore, apply the standards in these guidelines to all types of pages and content. Remember : Your assessment of harm happens before and overrides other considerations such as the life experience or expertise of the content creator. Can life experience justify a Highest quality rating for a page on a YMYL topic? Factual information and advice on YMYL topics should come from experts. Sharing life experience on YMYL topics can be Highest quality, but it must be trustworthy, safe, consistent with well-established expert consensus, and speak to topics that life experience is valuable for. For example, information about when and where to vote is a YMYL topic. It's possible to have a Highest quality page that shares life experience about voting, such as an inspiring personal post about becoming a citizen and voting for the first time. However, if a page about someone's voting experience gives inaccurate information about when and where to vote either deliberately or through careless oversight, the page should be rated Lowest because it could cause others to miss the opportunity to vote. You talked about expertise when rating MC. Does expertise matter for all topics? Aren't there some topics for which there are no experts? Remember that we are not just talking about formal expertise. Informal expertise is equally important, and for some topics may be a more common type of E-E-A-T. For most page purposes and topics, you can find experts even when the field itself is niche or non-mainstream. For example, there are expert alternative medicine websites created by leading practitioners of acupuncture, herbal therapy, etc. There are also pages about alternative medicine written by people with no expertise or experience. E-E-A-T should differentiate between these two scenarios. Reminder : If the page is harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as defined in these guidelines, expertise and experience doesn't matter. It should be rated Lowest .  92

- Question Answer When I think about E-E-A-T, it seems like expertise and experience overlap a lot. What's the difference? Here's one way to think about it: 
  -- Expertise often involves objective, testable knowledge or skills, for example: can you calculate the load bearing weight of a bridge? 
  -- Experience can be more subjective and is often shared through personal narration, for example: how does it feel to experience love for another person? For PQ rating, it's not important to distinguish between expertise and experience. Instead, focus on what kind of content is trustworthy and satisfying for the purpose of the page. You may find that both expertise and experience can be trustworthy and satisfying for the same topic. For example, a medical website may be a trustworthy source for treatment options, and the experiences of other people who have gone through treatment may provide emotional support and prepare you for what to expect. Aren't some types of pages always Low quality, such as celebrity gossip? For almost any type of page or informational topic, there is a range of content quality. For example, there are both High and Low quality celebrity gossip pages. The purpose of these pages is to share interesting, accurate information about celebrities. There may be benefits in celebrity stories that inspire others or help people going through similar challenges. A celebrity gossip page is High quality if it has accurate and interesting information, has no characteristics of Low or Lowest quality, and comes from a reasonably reliable source. I've never seen a High quality page of type X. If there are no high quality pages of this type, why are we giving existing pages a Low quality rating? For some topics or types of pages, there may not be many (or any!) High quality pages now, but there may be in the future. We need a uniform set of standards that apply to all pages, even for pages that have not yet been created. Some of these criteria seem unfair. For example, some art pages do not have a purpose. Are these pages Low quality? Art pages do have a purpose: artistic expression. Pages created for artistic expression do not deserve the Low quality rating simply because they have no other purpose. Artistic expression, humor, entertainment, sharing photos and videos, etc. are all valid and beneficial page purposes. How should interstitials factor into my rating? Sometimes clicking on the task URL will bring up an interstitial page. You can ignore this page in your rating criteria if you can easily get to the MC. However, if the interstitial makes it extremely hard (or impossible) to get to the MC and evaluate how well the page achieves its purpose, that should factor into your PQ rating.  93

- Part 3: Needs Met Rating Guideline Rating Using the Needs Met Scale There are many different kinds of queries and results, but the process of rating is the same: Needs Met rating tasks ask you to focus on user needs and think about how helpful and satisfying the result is for the users . This is what the Needs Met rating slider looks like: Rating Description Fully Meets (FullyM) A special rating category, which only applies to queries with clear intent to find one specific result and the corresponding specific result the user is looking for. Highly Meets (HM) A very helpful result for any dominant, common or reasonable minor query interpretation/user intent. Moderately Meets (MM) A helpful result for any dominant, common or reasonable minor query interpretation/user intent . Slightly Meets (SM) A less helpful result for a dominant, common or reasonable minor interpretation/user intent OR a helpful result for an unlikely minor query interpretation/user intent. Fails to Meet (FailsM) A result that completely fails to meet the needs of all or almost all users. For example, the result may be off-topic for the query or address a no chance interpretation of the query.  113

- Rating Result Blocks: Block Content and Landing Pages For Needs Met rating, you will assign a rating to each result. Each result includes the content inside the result block and landing pages associated with the result. Which part of the result do you rate? If a rating task specifically asks you to rate the Landing Page Needs Met or the Block Content Needs Met of each result, then you should follow the guidance in Section 13.. Unless these specific versions of Needs Met ratings are requested, you should follow the guidance below: Type of Block What to Rate Special Content Result Block (SCRB) Note: Assume that interactive result blocks function as intended. Try to interact with the result block as some links, buttons, or other features in your rating task may work. The content inside this type of block should always play a large role in your rating. Some Special Content Result Blocks may have links to landing pages. In these cases, think about whether a user would click on the link in order to satisfy their user need. 
  -- If most users would not click, rate the Special Content Result Block based on the block content alone. 
  -- If some or many users would click, you may consider the helpfulness of the landing page(s) in addition to the content in the block. In this case, both need to be helpful to justify a high rating. Web Search Result Block A click is required, and you should evaluate the landing page to assign a rating.  114

- Here are some examples of Special Content Result Blocks where the block should be rated primarily on the content inside the block itself. As always, please use your judgment. Query and Special Content Result Block Query : [utopia animal hospital] Query : [chicago weather] Query: [calories in a banana] Query : [how to find security code on visa] Query : [how did Lincoln die] Query : [movies san francisco] Note: The guidance in this section specifically applies to Needs Met ratings. For Special Content Result Blocks that have landing pages, you may or may not also be asked to provide PQ ratings. In these cases, your PQ rating should always be based on the landing page. Please refer to Section for more about the relationship between Needs Met and Page Quality ratings.  

-  Landing Page Needs Met Ratings and Block Content Needs Met Ratings In most cases, you should follow the instructions above when assigning Needs Met ratings. In some cases, though, a rating task may include special instructions that ask you to assign Landing Page Needs Met or Block Content Needs Met ratings. In these cases, follow the instructions below: Type of Needs Met Rating What to Rate Landing Page Needs Met Landing Page Needs Met ratings should be based exclusively on the landing page(s) links in the result block. This applies to both SCRBs and Web Search Result Blocks. The content that appears inside the result block should not factor into Landing Page Needs Met ratings. Block Content Needs Met Block Content Needs Met ratings should be based exclusively on the content inside the result block. This applies to both SCRBs and Web Search Result Blocks. Do not click through to any landing pages when rating Block Content Needs Met; landing page content should not factor into Block Content Needs Met ratings. 
  -- For Web Search Result Blocks, only consider the extent to which the page title, snippet, and any visual content within the block would directly address user need. 
  -- For SCRBs, only consider the extent to which the content within the block would directly address user need. Needs Met Follow the instructions in Section for standard Needs Met ratings.  117

- Highly Meets (HM) A rating of Highly Meets is assigned to very helpful results for any dominant, common, or reasonable minor interpretation or user intent of the query. Highly Meets results are highly satisfying and a good “fit” for reasonable interpretations and intents. In addition, they often have some of the following characteristics (depending on the query): 
  -- Entertaining or enjoyable for queries with a reasonable entertainment intent 
  -- Representative of the opinions, perspectives and experience of real people for queries with no single right answer 
  -- For informational queries, very helpful results that, for example: ○ Are easy to understand the content, e.g., helpful images or videos, an easy to understand summary ○ Provide in-depth or insightful content, e.g., a deep dive explanation, an expert analysis 
  -- For queries that benefit from recently created content, fresh results that provide up-to-date content on “what everyone is talking about right now” e.g., breaking news on a topic or the latest viral video or a hot new fashion trend Highly Meets results may be any type of content: articles, short form or long form video, images, social media posts, forum discussions, etc. There is no length requirement for Highly Meets results. Sometimes what makes a result satisfying is that it is short and easy to understand. Other results may be very satisfying because of the depth and richness of content. For some queries, comprehensiveness may be critically important, such as queries about truly complex topics or YMYL queries for which a short answer could be misleading. Accuracy is required for Highly Meets informational results. Highly Meets information pages on YMYL topics must be accurate and trustworthy. Highly Meets medical and scientific information pages must represent well-established scientific/medical consensus unless the user is clearly seeking an alternative viewpoint. A query can have many Highly Meets results. Search engines should strive to provide a diverse set of Highly Meets results from a variety of websites in a variety of content types from a variety of people and perspectives. This is especially important for queries with no single, "right answer", subjective queries, queries with multiple intents and interpretations, queries seeking opinions and perspectives, and queries simply looking to browse or explore the web. For most queries, Highly Meets is the highest possible rating a result can receive. Results rated Highly Meets represent the most helpful content available for a given query interpretation and user intent. Some queries have several Highly Meets results because there is a variety of very helpful content available on the internet that addresses reasonable query interpretations and user intents. Other queries may have no Highly Meets results at all because very helpful content doesn't exist on the internet or search engines are unable to find it. The standard for Highly Meets is very high. 13.Examples of Highly Meets (HM) Result Blocks Query and User Intent Result Rating Highly Meets Explanation Query: [trader joes] User Location: Charlotte, North Carolina User Intent: There are two possible user intents: most users probably want to visit a nearby location or go to the website. This result shows a complete list of all three locations in the Charlotte area, with information that is very helpful for users who want to visit the store. Note: This result block is not Fully Meets because users who want to go to the website to see coupons, promotions, etc. would have to see additional results.  123

- Query and User Intent Result Rating Slightly Meets Explanation Query: [ibm] User Intent: Go to the IBM website or find information about the company. This block contains images of the logo for IBM. These images are not a very helpful result for an unlikely minor intent of the query. Query: [chase] User Intent: Most users are looking for the official Chase bank website or a nearby branch. Some users may be interested in information about the bank. User Location : Kansas City, MO Most users in this locale are looking for the official Chase bank website. Very few people are looking for a definition of this common word. This is not a helpful result for most people. Query: [bears swimming] User intent: Find images, videos or information about bears swimming. Most users are looking for information about real bears, or images/videos of real bears swimming. This page sells a novelty t-shirt with an image of a bear swimming in a human athletic competition, which not many users would be looking for. Query : [allergy symptoms] User intent : Find information about allergy symptoms. This news article (current as of fall 2024) discusses falling leaves as an allergy trigger. The article does list some common seasonal allergy symptoms. However, this is not a medical resource, and it does not cover allergy symptoms for common issues such as food allergies, etc. Given that this may be a YMYL topic, a medical resource would be more helpful. There are many different types of allergies and many different allergy symptoms. This is a very specific article about falling leaves and has some allergy symptom information, but likely few people would find it very helpful.  133

- The Relationship between Page Quality and Needs Met The Needs Met rating is based on both the query and the result. You must carefully think about the query and user intent when assigning a Needs Met rating. The Page Quality rating slider does not depend on the query. Do not think about the query when assigning a Page Quality rating to the LP. Some results don’t have a Page Quality slider. If a result block has no Page Quality rating slider, you do not have to give a Page Quality rating. If there is a Page Quality slider, please assign a Page Quality rating based on the landing page. Here is some guidance about assigning Needs Met and Page Quality ratings: 
  -- Useless results should always be rated FailsM , even if the landing page has a high Page Quality rating. Useless is useless. 
  -- The HM rating is not appropriate if a page is untrustworthy or has any other undesirable characteristics, such as outdated or inaccurate information. There are very high standards for the HM rating. 
  -- A page can have such low Page Quality that it is unhelpful or even harmful, such as gibberish pages or scams. These types of extremely low quality pages should be rated FailsM because the Page Quality issues interfere with helpfulness. (An exception is queries with clear website intent, where the target website should be rated FullyM . People are allowed to search for any website and search engines should honor that intent when it is clear.)  141

- Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation Query: [symptoms of dehydration] User Intent: Find information about the symptoms of dehydration. Needs Met : Even though the article is topical, the information is not trustworthy and is potentially misleading or harmful. This result is unhelpful for the query. Page Quality : This is a YMYL topic. This page has no evidence of medical expertise/authority and is not trustworthy. Needs Met : This is a very helpful result for the query. Page Quality : This is a YMYL topic. This page is on a highly authoritative medical website and has a lot of reliable and accurate MC. This page is very trustworthy. Query: [how many octaves on a guitar] User Intent: Find out the number of octaves on a guitar. Needs Met : This block shows the number of octaves on a piano, not a guitar. Even though this block has a link to a high quality landing page about pianos, the information shown in the block is inaccurate with respect to the query. This result Fails to Meet the user need. Page Quality : There is a lot of helpful MC on the landing page. The page has medium to high E-E-A-T. Medium+ to High is an appropriate rating.  142

- Rating Porn, Foreign Language, and Did Not Load Results You will be asked to assign Porn , Foreign Language , and Did Not Load flags to result blocks when appropriate. Some rating tasks may also ask you to identify Upsetting-Offensive and/or Not-for-Everyone results. All flags should be assigned based on the result alone and do not depend on the query. Here is a screenshot of the flags: Click on the flag name to select it. The flag will turn red and change the “No” to “Yes.” For example, here is a result block that shows when the Foreign Language flag should be used. Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Flag Explanation Query: [baidu.com] Locale: English (US) User Intent: Go to the Baidu website. This LP is the homepage of the Baidu website. The result is the target page of the query, but is in a foreign language (Chinese). This result merits a FullyM rating and the Foreign Language flag. Porn Flag Please assign the Porn flag to all porn pages, whether the query is porn-seeking or not. The Porn flag does not depend on the query or user intent. This flag should be used if the content inside the result block, or the content on the LP, is pornographic, including porn images, links, text, pop-ups, and/or prominent porn ads. An image may be considered porn in one culture or country, but not another. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale. Remember : The Porn flag is used to indicate that the result is porn. It doesn’t matter whether the query “asks for porn”. Needs Met Rating for Porn Results 15.Needs Met Rating for Clear Non-Porn Intent Queries If the user intent is clearly not porn-seeking, a landing page that has porn for its MC should be rated Fails to Meet . 
  -- When the user intent is clearly not porn, a porn result should be considered unhelpful or useless. 
  -- Uninvited porn is a very bad experience for many users. The following queries should be considered non-porn intent queries: [girls], [wives], [mature women], [gay people], [people kissing], [boy speedos], [moms and sons], [pictures of girls], [pictures of women], [mothers and daughters], [cheerleaders], etc.  143

- Remember to assign the Porn flag for all porn pages. Use your judgment and represent users in your locale . Query User Intent Landing Page Rating Porn Flag? [toys], English (US) Find toys to buy. Example Warning – this page is porn. FailsM Yes [how tall is a camel], English (US) Find the answer to this question about camels. Example Warning – this page is porn. FailsM Yes [car pictures], English (US) Find pictures of cars. Example Warning – this page is porn. FailsM Yes 15.Needs Met Rating for Possible Porn Intent Queries Some queries have both non-porn and porn interpretations. For example, the following English (US) queries have both a non-porn and an erotic or porn interpretation: [breast], [sex]. We will call these queries “possible porn intent” queries. For "possible porn intent" queries, please rate as if the non-porn interpretation were dominant, even though some or many users may be looking for porn. For example, please rate the English (US) query [breast] assuming a dominant health or anatomy information intent. Query User Intent Landing Page Rating Porn flag? [breasts], English (US) Find anatomy or health information about breasts. Example HM No [breasts], English (US) Find anatomy or health information about breasts. Example Warning – this page is porn. FailsM Yes 15.Needs Met Rating for Clear Porn Intent Queries For very clear porn intent queries, assign a rating to the porn landing page based on how helpful it is for the user. Even though there is porn intent, the page should still be assigned a Porn flag. Do not simply rate all porn pages for porn queries as MM or HM . Even though the query is porn and the result is porn, the page must fit the query and be helpful to get a high Needs Met rating. Pages that provide a poor user experience, such as pages that try to download malicious software, should also receive low ratings, even if they have some images appropriate for the query. Query User Intent Landing Page Rating Porn Flag? [freeones], English (US) Navigate to the Freeones homepage. Example: http://www.freeones.com Warning – this page is porn. FullyM Yes [freeones], English (US) Navigate to the Freeones homepage. Example: http://www.baberoad.com Warning – this page is porn. FailsM Yes [anime sex pictures], English (US) Find anime sex pictures. Example Warning – this page is porn. MM to HM Yes [cheerleader porn], English (US) Find porn pictures of cheerleaders. Example Warning – this page is porn. MM to HM Yes  144

- Here is a screenshot of a result block that shows when the Foreign Language flag would be used. Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Flag Explanation Query: [baidu] Locale: English (US) User Intent: Go to the Baidu website. This LP is the homepage of the Baidu website. The result is the target page of the query, but is in a foreign language (Chinese). This result merits a FullyM rating and the Foreign Language flag. Important : 
  -- Please assign the Foreign Language flag even if you personally understand the language, but most users in your locale do not. 
  -- Please assign the Foreign Language flag based on the language of the landing page, not the appearance of the result block. 
  -- Please remember to flag all foreign pages with the Foreign Language flag, even if most users in your locale would expect or want a foreign language page for the query. 
  -- Sometimes it is difficult to determine what language the landing page is in. The LP may have multiple languages or no words at all. In these cases, try to represent users in your locale. Does it feel like a foreign language page? When in doubt, don’t use the Foreign Language flag. 15.Needs Met Rating for Foreign Language Results You must assign a Needs Met rating for all result blocks in your task, even if the result blocks have a foreign language landing page. In most cases, pages you flag as Foreign Language should be rated FailsM , because they cannot be understood by most users in your locale and are therefore useless. Remember that if users in your locale can read the language, then you shouldn’t be using the Foreign Language flag. Occasionally, you will encounter helpful Foreign Language pages. If the query clearly indicates that most users would expect or want a foreign language result, then the Needs Met rating of the foreign language page should not be FailsM . For example, please assign the FullyM rating and Foreign Language flag for baidu.com if the query is [baidu.com], English (US). Videos are often an example where foreign language pages are helpful and desired. Think about user intent and what pages are good for users. If the query “asks” for a foreign language song, band, film, sporting event, etc., then a video of the song, band, film, sporting event, etc. is helpful since it can probably be understood or enjoyed even though it is in a foreign language. For these types of queries, foreign language results are often expected. If the video is someone talking about the song, band, film, or event, the result probably cannot be understood or enjoyed and should be assigned a FailsM rating and the Foreign Language flag. Note: If you are unable to evaluate the Page Quality rating of a Foreign Language result, you do not need to assign a Page Quality rating and can leave the slider at N/A .  146

- Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation Query: [video of celine dion singing s’il suffisait d’aimer] Locale: English (US) User Intent: Watch a video of Celine Dion singing this song. This video is just what English (US) users are looking for, even though the video is not in English. The language of the LP is mostly English (even though the video is in French), so the Foreign Language flag is not needed. Query: [kasal, kasali, kasalo] Locale: English (US) User Intent: Watch a trailer of this Filipino film or find information about it. The query is for “Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo,” a Filipino film. The LP is a clip from the movie in Filipino (Tagalog), the language spoken in the Philippines. It would be helpful for many English (US) users who type the query, even though it is not in English. Use your judgment when deciding whether to assign the Foreign Language flag.  147

- Did Not Load Flag 15.Using the Did Not Load Flag Did Not Load is used to indicate technical problems with the webpage that prevent users from viewing any LP content. Use the Did Not Load flag when: 
  -- The MC of the landing page is a web server or web application error message and there is no other content on the page: no navigation links, no home link, no SC, and no Ads. See here for a Wikipedia page on different types of error messages. 
  -- The landing page is completely blank: no MC, no SC, and no Ads. Assign the Did Not Load flag based on the landing page, not the result block. Here is an example of a Did Not Load landing page. You cannot tell that the landing page doesn’t load by looking at the result block.

Specificity of Queries and Landing Pages Some queries are very general and some queries are specific. Here are some examples that compare levels of specificity of English (US) queries: Query More Specific Query Even More Specific Query [chair] [dining room chair] [ikea “henriksdal” highback upholstered chair] [library] [harvard library] [harvard anthropology library] [interview questions] [interview questions for teachers] [practice interview questions used for teach for america] [restaurants] [chinese restaurants] [takeout chinese restaurants in downtown Austin] [coffee shops] [starbucks] [red rock coffee mountain view] Results for specific queries are easier to rate on the Needs Met scale because we know more about what the user is looking for. Giving a Needs Met rating for results for general queries can be difficult. As always, your rating is based on how helpful the result is for the query, not the specificity fit. When the query is a broad category, such as [cafes] [restaurants] [hotels] [books] [tourist attractions in paris] etc., popular and prominent examples may be considered very helpful. Please do web research to help you understand what is popular and prominent in different locations.  153

- Needs Met Rating and Freshness Some queries demand very recent or “fresh” information. Users may be looking for “breaking news,” such as an important event or natural disaster happening right now. Here are different types of queries demanding current/recent results. Type of Query Example Queries Explanation “Breaking news” queries [tornado], [tsunami] Assume users need the information right away. Imagine someone who needs immediate weather information because a big storm is coming. Information about last year's weather would not be helpful. Recurring event queries, such as elections, sports events, TV shows, conferences, etc. [olympics], [american idol], [redsox schedule], [tax forms], [elections] Assume users are looking for the most recent or current information about the event. For example, if the Olympics are happening right now, users searching [olympics] want information about the current Olympics, not results from years ago. If the next Olympics are a few months away, users are probably interested in the upcoming Olympics. Current information queries [population of paris], [amount of u.s. debt], [airfare from ny to sfo], [next federal holiday] Assume users are looking for the most current information, such as prices or airfare. Product queries [iphone], [toyota camry], [windows operating system] Assume users are looking for information about the most recent model/version for these product queries. When a query demands recent content, only pages with current, recent, or updated content should get high Needs Met ratings. For these queries, pages about past events, old product models and prices, outdated information, etc. are not helpful. They should be considered “stale” and given low Needs Met ratings. In some cases, stale results are useless and should be rated FailsM . For some queries, there may be “newsy” or recent information user intent, as well as more “timeless” information user intent. Users issuing queries for celebrities or politicians may be interested in biographical information, or users may be looking for the latest news or gossip. Freshness is generally less of a concern for Page Quality rating. “Stale” pages can have high Page Quality ratings. For example, some highly reputable news websites maintain “archival” content. However, unmaintained/abandoned “old” websites or unmaintained and inaccurate/misleading content is a reason for a low Page Quality rating. Note : The date the page was created may be different from when the content was last updated or modified. When content is updated, the page will sometimes show the date of the update, not the date the page was created. Some websites always show the current date, regardless of when the content was last updated. If you are curious about the content of a page, see here to try the “Wayback Machine” on the Internet Archive. Not all pages are available, but this tool may help you understand how some pages were created and how their content has changed over time.  157

- Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation Query: [los angeles traffic] User Location: Los Angeles, California User Intent: Users are looking for current information about traffic conditions in Los Angeles. Even pages about traffic conditions the day before would be considered stale for the query. This LP shows traffic conditions in Los Angeles on August 7, 2012, which is the day this example was written. This LP shows traffic conditions in Los Angeles on August 6, 2012. It is stale and useless for the query even though it is only one day old. Query: [nobel peace prize winner] User Intent: Find the name of the most recent winner of this prize. This is a Know Simple query. At the time this example was originally written, 2011 was the most recent year that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded. This LP on the New York Times website has information about the most recent winner of this prize, based on the date when this example was written. This LP on the BBC website has information about the 2006 winner of this prize. The 2006 winners of the prize may is an extremely minor interpretation of the query, so this page is stale for the query.  158

- Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation Query: [arthritis] User Intent : Users are looking for information about this disease. Because there is ongoing research done on treatments and cures for most diseases, users are probably looking for authoritative, up-to-date information on arthritis. Medline Plus is an authoritative website that regularly updates its content. This 2006 article is extremely stale for this medical query. For this type of query, old medical news is generally unhelpful and potentially dangerous. Query: [when was franklin d roosevelt born] User Intent: Users want to find this well understood fact. This LP has the information users are looking for. This query does not require fresh results. We couldn’t find a stale page for this query. N/A Misspelled and Mistyped Queries and Results Misspelled and Mistyped Queries You will notice that some queries are misspelled or mistyped. Here are some examples of queries that are obviously misspelled: Misspelled Query Query Interpretation [federal expres], English (US) The only reasonable query interpretation is the company named Federal Express. [new england patroits], English US) The only reasonable interpretation is the NFL football team. [byonce knowles], English (US) The only reasonable interpretation is the famous singer/actress, Beyonce Knowles. Some misspelled or mistyped queries are more difficult to interpret. Use your judgment and do query research. For obviously misspelled or mistyped queries, you should base your rating on user intent, not necessarily on exactly how the query has been spelled or typed by the user. For queries that are not obviously misspelled or mistyped, you should respect the query as written, and assume users are looking for results for the query as it is spelled.  159

- Name Queries Consider the query [john stuart], English (US). There is a very famous Jon Stewart, the comedian and former host of a popular U.S. television show. However, we should not assume that the query [john stuart] has been misspelled. There are many people named John Stuart. We will respect the query as written and assume the user is looking for someone named “John Stuart.” Query and Possible User Intents Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation Query: [mich ea l jordan], English (US) User Intent: There are many people named “Micheal Jordan.” Helpful results for more prominent people named Micheal Jordan should receive higher ratings than helpful results for less prominent people named Micheal Jordan. Because Michael Jordan is such a famous athlete/celebrity, we will consider Michael Jordan to be an unlikely minor interpretation. The page lists all members of the LinkedIn site named “Micheal Jordan.” LinkedIn is a very popular social networking website for professionals in the U.S. This result would be very helpful for users trying to find information about someone named “Micheal Jordan.” This is a somewhat helpful result for an unlikely minor interpretation of the query. 2

-  Non-Fully Meets Results for URL Queries Raters sometimes ask the question, “For a well-formed working URL query, are the only acceptable Needs Met ratings for a result either Fully Meets or Fails to Meet ?” The answer is no. There can be other helpful results for URL queries. Finding information about a website is a reasonable interpretation and intent for URL queries, as some users issue URL queries to find information about a website, such as reviews or recent news. We recommended this to you as one method of reputation research in the PQ guidelines. Real users do this too. Results that give reviews and reputation information can be very helpful for a URL query. However, websites that offer usage statistics about a website are not usually helpful results for URL queries. Most users aren’t interested in this kind of information.  160

- Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation Query: [potterybarn.com] User Intent: Pottery Barn is a home furnishing store. Users may want to go to the website, do research, or find more information on the company. This LP is the target of the query. Online coupon codes are very popular in the U.S. and this LP (from a well-known coupon site) displays codes for online purchases on the Pottery Barn website. Users may be interested in coupon codes and this would be very helpful for those shopping online at potterybarn.com, especially frequent shoppers. This LP (from a well-known review site) has reviews of the potterybarn.com website. Users may be interested in reading reviews when considering whether to make purchases at potterybarn.com, especially new shoppers. Query: [ratemyprofessors.com] User Intent: Go to www.ratemyprofessors.com , a website where students can rate their college professors. This LP is the target of the query. This LP is an extensive encyclopedia article for the queried URL. It contains many helpful sections, including information detailing the rating process, comparison with in-class evaluations, criticism, etc. This is a very helpful result for a reasonable interpretation of the query.  161

- Product Queries: Importance of Browsing and Researching Some product queries, such as [ipad reviews], have a clear information-seeking ( Know ) intent. Other product queries, such as [buy ipad], have a clear purchase ( Do ) intent. And some product queries, such as [ipad store.apple.com], have a clear navigation ( Website ) intent. However, most product queries don’t obviously specify one type of intent. Keep in mind that many users enjoy browsing and visually exploring products online, similar to window shopping in real life. Give high Needs Met ratings to results that allow users to research, browse, and decide what to purchase. Users may not always plan to buy products online that they are browsing and researching, for example, cars or major appliances. Even though the ultimate goal may be to purchase a product, many other activities may take place first: researching the product (reviews, technical specifications), understanding the options that are available (brands, models, pricing), viewing and considering various options (browsing), etc. Important : Page Quality ratings for product results need extra care and attention. Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating Explanation Query: [high definition tv] User Intent: This query doesn’t specify a size or brand of TV. Users are probably doing research before making a purchase. This LP has comprehensive information about different types of high definition TVs (plasma, LCD, LED), as well as reviews about many specific models. The website is known for having helpful reviews and information about electronics. Query: [girl toddler jeans size 3T] User Intent: The query is very specific. The user wants to browse and find an item to buy. This is a helpful page for browsing and shopping for toddler girls jeans. There are many options for jeans in size 3T. This is a high quality store known for selling jeans. Query: [cufflinks] User Intent: Most users probably want to find different cufflink styles and options to browse or purchase. This LP has a large collection of cufflinks from a very reputable retailer. There are many options and styles. This is a good page for browsing. There are helpful features at the top to choose styles, price ranges, etc.  162

- Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation Query: [twist of fate ring pandora] User Intent: The user is looking for a specific ring sold by the Pandora brand and likely wants to research the ring, see what it looks like, find options to browse or purchase, etc. This result has a variety of images of the ring, showing different angles and materials. Knowing what the ring looks like is very helpful to users who are researching the product and browsing options that are available. Rating Visit-in-Person Intent Queries When there is a user location for a visit-in-person intent query and a location has not been specified in the query itself, such as [chinese restaurants] with a user location of Boston, MA , results in or near the user location are the most helpful. How close is “near”? The type of business and/or entity should be taken into consideration when deciding if the distance of the visit-in-person result is too far. For example, most people are not willing to travel very far for a gas station, coffee shop, supermarket, etc. Those are types of businesses that most users expect to find nearby. However, users might be willing to travel a little farther for certain kinds of visit-in-person results: doctors’ offices, libraries, specific types of restaurants, public facilities like swimming pools, hiking trails in open spaces, etc. Sometimes users may accept results that are even farther away, such as a very specialized medical clinic. In other words, when we say users are looking for results “nearby,” the word “nearby” can mean different distances for different queries. As always, please use your judgment.  163

- Examples Where User Location Does (and Does Not) Matter As previously mentioned, the user location may not always change our understanding of the query and user intent. Below is one example where user location plays an important role, and two examples where user location does not matter. Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation Query: [minimum wage rate] User Location: Wichita, Kansas User Intent: Find out what the current minimum wage is. Different states in the U.S. have different minimum wage rates. Users might be interested in the minimum wage in their state and how it compares to other places. This result block displays the complete and correct answer prominently in the result block, in a way that is easy for users on mobile devices to read. Note : Assume that the result shows current information for users at the time this example was written. If you were rating this task, you would need to verify that the minimum wage rate in this result block is accurate for the state of Kansas. This is the official Kansas state website page on minimum wage for Kansas. This LP has the minimum wage rates for all states. It is on the official U.S. Department of Labor website. Though it takes some work to find the information specific to Kansas, this is a very helpful result for users seeking general information about the minimum wage rate. This is the official California state website page on minimum wage for California. Given the user location, this is an unhelpful result.  164

- Query and User Intent Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating Explanation Query: [amazon jobs] User Location: Miami, Florida User Intent: Users are looking for job opportunities at Amazon. The user is looking for a job at Amazon and there is no information in this result block that will help the user explore job opportunities—it Fails to Meet the user need. This is Amazon’s official page on careers and jobs at Amazon, where users can search for currently open opportunities. This page is exactly what the user is looking for—it Fully Meets the user need.  165

- Rating English Language Results in Non-English Locales The following rating guidance is for raters in non-English locales. You may stop reading this section if your task language is English, such as English (US), English (IN), English (NG), etc. Your Needs Met ratings should reflect how helpful the result is for users in your locale. When the query is in the language of your locale, assume that users want results in that language. We know that you can read English (you are reading this document!), but you should only give high Needs Met ratings to English results if users in your locale would expect or want them for a particular query. Unless requested by the query, English results should be considered useless if most users in the locale can't read them. However, rating can be more difficult when the query includes English names, words, etc., or when it's unclear whether English results would be satisfying for a particular query. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale to determine the appropriate rating. Important: Please keep in mind that every locale will have unique considerations regarding the number and variety of languages (such as official languages, regional languages, local dialects, etc.), writing systems, and keyboard input languages commonly in use. While these guidelines may not include examples for your locale, it is important that you represent users in your task location and culture in order to interpret the query and rate results. When in doubt, please assume that users would prefer results in the task language unless the query clearly indicates otherwise.  166

- Examples of English (and Non-English) Results in Non-English Locales The section includes some examples using Hindi (IN) and Korean (KR) as the locales. In both cases, we cannot assume that users in these locales—i.e., Hindi-speaking users in India, or Korean-speaking users in Korea—are able to read English. Unless most users in the locale would be satisfied by English results for the query, we will consider them unhelpful or even useless ( FailsM ).
